"1","I've had this Kindle for a while now. Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us all?Do you have any clue what you bought? Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark? Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light, the Paperwhite and Voyage do.Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. Could you not see when you clicked on ""BUY"" that this Kindle had no page turning buttons. Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. If you can tell by my sarcasm, I belong to the latter bunch.Then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is, are unable to sign on, and blame it on the Kindle. BAM! another 1 star review. Well I feel for you on this one, If you are new to the scene all Kindles come wifi ready, ready to sign on to your wifi set up at home. When this is done you can buy book from your Kindle or computer. All of your purchases are held in that magical storage space called ""the cloud"" and you can access those from any Kindle registered under your name.Now for my two cents. This is a great Kindle. The software is the latest, similar to the Paperwhite. It's quick, has any feature you could ask for from an entry level Kindle. I don't understand the hate for touch screen. You should embrace it. See that word on the page you don't know? Touch it with your finger and a dictionary pops up giving you the definition. How many clicks on the Kindle Keyboard would this same function take (still have my Keyboard and love it, but probably like one loves an antique typewriter). As far as page turns go, see my nano meter thumb comment above. Once you get used to it it's a piece of cake. Hey, the first time I picked up an iPhone to type a text message ""how are you?"" it came out ""lskdlj eiieoi c;?"" You need to acclimate yourself to a touch screen. Once you do those page turning buttons will start to feel like cheap little bits of plastic that will eventually stop working.Under a lamp or in natural daylight the text is bold and easy to see. Some fonts are bolder than others. This is also a very light Kindle. I've found kind of a sweet spot for holding Kindles. Pinching the bezel to hold it is awkward. I place the bottom left corner in the middle of my palm, rest the back of it on my four fingers, and tilt it slightly to the left so it doesn't fall in my lap. My thumb is perfectly free to move that nano meter to turn a page.So let's sum up:*This Kindle does not have a light.*This Kindle does not have page turning buttons.*This Kindle (like all Kindles) has wifi capability. When you are home on your wifi you can buy and download books from the Kindle store. If you go to the beach, you cannot. If you want this then get 3G. This is like a cell phone. Personally I've never needed to buy a book outside of my home so never felt the need for 3G.If this helps one person it was worth typing."
"2","I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at $79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because $119 to $400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at $79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles.  It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter.  That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for $15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or $20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark. Looking at the display side-by-side in the same location of an eBook against the versions of Kindle mentioned above, the text on this Kindle is much darker and reads a lot better. Compared to a Paperwhite it is not as dark but those results are to be expected since the Paperwhite has 25%+ more pixels per inch, but at this price point that's not too big of a concern for me as each new version of the Kindle gets better and better with the fonts and screen display and this one is pretty darn good - you want to be able to read what you're supposed to, right?If you like the text-to-speech feature of previous Kindle models or listened to music with your previous Kindle, please be aware there are no speakers nor is there a plug for headphones.Web surfing speed with the wireless is about the same as with other versions of the e-Ink Kindles: slow as Christmas!  My usual test of the connectivity on a Kindle was hitting the main pages of the mobile websites of Fox News, CNN, and Google. I pushed ""go"" or ""enter"" buttons / icons at the same time on each and did not see a visible difference in the load speeds start to finish: I was about 50 yards away from my wireless router at home with a couple of walls in the way for the wireless test, with similar results at my office after the Kindle arrived. I did try to check one of my Google email accounts but it crashed.  I learned a couple of years ago to not try and surf the Internet with an e-Ink Kindle because it's so darn slow; besides, I use the Kindle to read a book and I can surf the Internet or check my email on my other devicesIn comparison the previous version of Kindle this one is replacing, other than the crisper text / fonts from the improved screen display, as far as I can tell this new version of Kindle has the same technical specifications of the previous Kindle: about the same size, same internal memory. If you had a precious version of the Kindle this version is replacing, that means you can use the same cover as the previous version.Battery life is supposed to last ""...weeks on a single charge"" but I doubt it: I charged it up 100% late yesterday afternoon and, 24 hours later, the battery meter is indicating about 50% left. This was with the Wi-Fi left on but the Kindle not being used overnight as I left it in the office in sleep mode.  Time will tell if this is going to be a problem or not.It did take a few minutes to get this model up and running as, in addition to the normal making sure it is registered and going through a mandatory tutorial on which areas of the screen to tap to perform various functions, there is a lot of Amazon marketing you have to weed through: do you want to sign up for Goodreads (an Amazon affiliate), would you like to sign up for Kindle Unlimited (for a monthly recurring revenue stream to Amazon), would you like to link your Facebook and Twitter accounts so your're friends / family / perfect strangers can be voyeuristic on what you are reading (absolutely not for me).You can also sign up for parental controls with this version which I think is a great idea - sometimes you don't want your children to read what you are reading.One annoying thing (to me, at least) is the automatic import of the various categories / collections you have linked to your Amazon account onto this version and links to the books in the Cloud that you can immediately download in the same category on the new Kindle.  If you're replacing an older Kindle with this one that could be handy, but if you have other people on your account / family in households with more than one Kindle, that can be a pain in the neck because, for example, my wife and I generally have different tastes in books - I don't want her books cluttering up my Kindle's screen and she feels the same way about mine.  IT's not a deal killer, but it does make you wade through a lot of stuff.Despite some of my nits above, as a parent whose children can be hard on electronics I likethis version, and think with this $79 price point it will help to continue to explode the eBook revolution even faster as they get in more people's hands. If you have not purchased a Kindle before due to price, need a cheaper replacement than the other versions, or maybe a relative or a friend has hesitated to get one this one is in your price zone, I would recommend this one!"
"3","I got this Kindle during a Black Friday sale at Best Buy last year. They had this Kindle and one of the Kindle Fires discounted and I was torn between which one to buy. I finally went with this one because I don't really need another device on which, essentially, to watch Netflix! While I am an avid reader, this was my first e-reader purchase. I'd read entire books on my laptop and smart phone before so I'm not one of those ""I'll only ever read a real book because that's how it's meant to be"" people. I think e-readers are great. I'd just never made it a point to buy one with all the unread books I already have lying around the house. That being said, I love my Kindle now. Since November I've probably read close to twenty books. It's just so easy. Using this particular Kindle also has the added benefit that it's just an e-reader. Not a tablet, i.e. a trove of distractions. I am delighted by the fact that I can just take trip with my little device and have more books than I need. It really makes me feel like I am living in the future. I find it amazing every time that it's a Saturday night and I find out about something I need to read immediately, I can just get on the Kindle store and buy a new book without ever having to leave my house. I also love the size. It fits in any of my handbags or coat pockets. I think it's intuitive and easy to use. I love that it's glare-free because I tend to spend a lot of time outside and I can see the text no matter how bright the sun is shining. The battery life is great. Since owning it, I've probably charged it three times. I would highly recommend the cover Amazon has for this model. It's really handy. I'm attaching a picture to show what a lovely addition Kindle with the cover makes to an already wonderful day. I'm definitely glad I bought this over a tablet. It's perfect for me."
"4","Pros: Anti-glare Book-like screen(should have been a bit brighter though).Eye-friendly.Quick reach to dictionaries and translations.Word-wise is a good feature.Easy reach to Wiki.Havent used X-Ray so cant comment on that.Light weight. Easy to use. Handy.Cons: Almost none if you look at it as an e-reader.A small brightness setting would have helped :D"
"5","I finally got a Kindle because I had to take a 3-week trip to Rotterdam from California. I knew I would never be able to carry as many books as I would need, especially since we were going to need to carry a number of things back with us. It was a long flight with layovers both ways, and sleeping was nearly impossible in the cramped plane.I loaded the Kindle with e-books (I had a collection by one of my favorite authors, and there are lots of free books to download, and I decided to try Kindle Ultimate while I was at it) and packed it into my computer bag. It saved my life during the flight and the trip both. My husband thinks I should have gotten the one with its own lighting, but now that I'm home again, access to a reading light is not an issue.The text is amazingly clear--really, my graphics geek husband marveled over it--and being able to adjust the size means that even if I've forgotten my reading glasses, I can still read. (They don't always make it from one room to the other.) The faint gray tone to the background seems odd for a moment, but then completely natural.Battery life has generally been very good. It helps to actually turn the screen off when not reading. I don't mind seeing the ads, but they do use up power. I left the Wi-Fi turned off the entire time I was in Rotterdam, and I think that helps save power, too.I got the power adapter, but since that only works in the US, I just charged the Kindle by connecting it to my computer. Now that I'm home, I have the power connector next to my bed, so I can charge while reading.I expect to be buying e-books rather than paperbacks from now on, which is just as well, as even my abundant shelving is starting to overflow. I only wish I could ""rip"" my existing book collection to Kindle format."
"6","This does not have a light.  I am returning it.  This is the 3rd Kindle I have had.  The first one just broke.  The 2nd one was working great then suddenly it would not let me page back and I had to restart it at least once a day.  So, I bought this one and it doesn't have a light.  I guess its my fault for not reading information closer.  I would give up on this technology except I am addicted to cheaper books, lighting and light weight books. Anyway, this goes back tomorrow and I'll order an upgrade.  Sighhhhhhhhh."
"7","Can you download and play games with this kindle"
"8","No one could explain to me how to work it. The instructions do not help. I had one question not even customer service could answer and instruct me in its use. How do I get the book I bought loaded onto the Kindle. Just to tell me to use WiFi does not help. How do I use WiFi?Anyway I sent it back.JA"
"9","Not happy. The old 5-button Kidle was better. The screen is too sensitive at times and not sensitive enough at other times. When you shut off and return the book you're reading isn't moved to the top of the list. You have t remember the title to reopen the book.I had to try five times to remove a book from the device. In general I don't like the new Kindle."
"10","I lost my old kindle.  I don't like this one like my other one.  If you power it off it does not save the place where you left off reading- even when you use the book marker.  Also it keeps going back to the smaller print even though I change the font on the tool bar."
"11","Small, light, easy to carry (even with the Amazon case) it's perfect for reading outdoors and on flights"
"12","It is perfect in that I just wanted an e-reader with no distractions so I focus more time on reading, and one I could slip right into my purse.  I was at a medieval fair recently and purchased a little satchel that works perfectly for holding e-reader and Fire phone.The screen on this e-reader is a bit dark.  I recently ordered a clip on reading light - I think this will help immensely and bump it up another star for me. I didn't realize that you cannot read in the dark with the Kindle Glare Free without light in the room or a reading light.  I opted to order a clip on light rather than upgrade to the paperwhite to rest my eyes since I am on a computer all day at work and a tablet at home in personal time.I've had the Kindle Fire 7"" and the Nook HD+ - it took me a few moments to adjust to the light weight of the e-reader and the matte finish of the screen.  But it is nice little reader overall."
"13","I have numerous Kindles, including the previous low end Kindle which I use for running around.  I like having an inexpensive, password protected device so that if I were to leave it somewhere, I am not out a great deal of money, and my credit cards are protected.  Also, the higher end devices have too much reflection to enable reading outdoors.  I don't take my higher end Kindle devices out of the house.I really didn't need this device, but I was curious about it.  I then ran into a note which stated that Staples had the device for $59 with a $30 rebate (Visa gift card)!  I ran to pick it up. (Available until 12/27, FYI.)It's a nice device.  The screen is very readable with good contrast.  The device and screen have a good ""hand feel"".  It's heavier than the previous Kindle, but not by much.  With a lightweight case, it's very portable.The interface is really a pleasure, and I'm happy to be done with the scroll through keyboard which was on the previous device.  Everything on this device is done via a screen tap.The new device has double the memory, (4G as opposed to 2G on the previous device), and is developed to enable updates which make it the equivalent of a Paperwhite in functionality (without the light, of course).  So, minus the light, this device is incredibly well priced (even at full retail).If you need a light, check out the M-edge cases which have a slip pocket into which you can insert one of M-edge e-illuminator reading lights.  I prefer them to a clip on light.I use my Kindles for different things:  My Fires for films, gaming and sometimes reading, but for a true, enhanced reading experience, I use either my Paperwhite, my old Touch, or this new device.  I love the vocabulary builder function, as well as X-ray.  I often read complex books, i.e. mysteries or biographies, and X-ray makes it much easier to keep characters, terms, etc. straight.  I also have found that i prefer reading on a Kindle to a book.  I find that I finish books more quickly, and enjoy having the ability to read for a few minutes while waiting for an appointment, etc.If you are new to Kindle, and want a great reading experience, this is a great place to start.  Also, if you need a gift, or want to introduce children to an e-reader this is an unbeatable opportunity!A couple of tips:Set up is easy, and takes just a few minutes.  If you don't want to set up social media, or join Goodreads, just skip them for now.  You can add them later.  You MUST be connected to WiFi to set up your device, so have your password handy if your WiFi is password protected.  If you purchase from Amazon via your account, the device should already be set up for you.The device shows recommendations on the bottom of the home screen.  This takes up a lot of space, which causes you to have to scroll through screens more often to view your library.  Go to Settings, tap Device Options, tap Personalize, tap Recommendations and you can turn them off.  This will double your home screen display area, and enables you to preserve the picture format for book display (as opposed to a list format).Questions?  Post, and I'll get back to you.Enjoy, and Happy Holidays!"
"14","If you've used a Kindle before and just want the simplicity of a great base-model eReader then this is for you. No keyboard, no 3G, no fancy color screen, no backlight, ads to offset the cost (and you can pay to remove if they bother you). I don't use it for apps or games or Internet browser (I've got my iPhone for that). I love that you can add your own eBooks. I use ""calibre"" to manage the metadata."
"15","It is too complicated to use.  I really dislike it."
"16","no, once again, THERE IS NO LIGHT! Why are you  not reading the description, those who are so offended by some reviews? Here, I've taken a screenshot for you. NO.BUILT.IN.LIGHT. Clear, now?"
"17","When you set up the cloud for the books I bought for the kindle what was the password?"
"18","Is my device faulty or it is normal for Kindle to hang and get a messed up screen until you restart?(See the attached photo)."
"19","It is terrible that Amazon continues to sell merchandise that uses unauthorized photographs and art that they have specifically been asked to remove from their website as it is violating copyright law. They also refuse to provide the contaact information to the owner of the stolen copywrite material.Feel free to steal anything that belongs to Amazon. They and their lawyers are of the opinion that anything on the internet can be taken without compensation. Amazon has a poor business model. I hope they are found guilty and liable for all lost profits and sales due to their disregard of the law.BOYCOT AMAZON."
"20","Great ereader got it in the Prime day sale for only $50. I do recommend getting a light maybe a case if you are going to travel, take it to school, or just clumsy like me. The reason I gave four stars was beacuse when reading inside with a light I still got a glare its not  bad enough to interup my reading but it is a  disappointment. If you have a light close up it can glare but outside or with a  ceiling light it is great! It also depends on the angle with close up lights the last pics are with the same light as second just different  angle. I wish that I could turn off one click payment on kindle store. I had to turn Kindle store completely off in parental controls so that if my kindle got stolen the couldn't use my one click payment method. I just get Books on my computer instead and send them to my kindle."
"21","Disappointed"
"22","Had I never owned another Kindle, this most likely would have received a higher rating. Unfortunately, in comparing it to my older Kindle, the ""benefits"" of the touch-screen technology can't compare to the features no longer there. For those of you unfamiliar with the older Kindles, nothing was touch-screen and, instead, was all keyboard/button-driven, with the keyboard built-in at the bottom of the Kindle and the page turning buttons on both sides of the device. Yes, it was a bit larger and heavier, but it was SO MUCH EASIER to use than this new one with more features that are only available with a built-in keyboard.I bought this to replace my older, ailing Kindle, hoping the new one would fit into the old cover that I bought with a light in it and loved. Not only does it not fit, there is no lighted cover to go with this new Kindle even available. Considering how expensive that old cover was, I wonder if all these different sizes and non-compatibility issues are ploys (planned obsolescence) on Amazon's part to force customers to have to spend a lot more money than is necessary.Pros: lighter weight; more secure in the separately sold cover; if it’s being used only for reading and nothing else (such as highlighting, games, etc.), it works wellCons:- Other than turning pages by tapping on the R or L side of the display, I haven’t found much about this  new Kindle to be very intuitive (easy to figure out). Reading the 62-page “Kindle User’s Guide, 2nd Edition” is pretty much a requirement. Although this guide comes with the purchase, it would have been nice to be able to just start reading rather than spending hours figuring out the new features.- The new highlighting feature is so unusable, it may as well have been removed:  Instead of highlighting, it literally darkens the selected text, making it HARDER to read. In my old Kindle, highlighting underlined the selected text, which was nice - it stood out, without impairing legibility. In addition, have not found a way to highlight across pages. i.e., if a section to be highlighted spans more than one page, there doesn't appear to be a way to extend the highlight beyond the current screen. The only workarounds I’ve found is either to separately highlight each page or to decrease the font size small enough to get everything onto one page. The problem with the latter is it becomes MUCH more difficult to then accurately select the section desired. The fingertip is now proportionately so much bigger than the screen, it tends to select 2 or 3 lines above or below what's wanted. Time-consuming and frustrating.- Certain games no longer work because they require a “keyboard.” The game and the virtual, touch-screen keyboard will no longer fit on this smaller Kindle. Amazon will refund you for what you paid for the game in these cases, but I’d rather have the games work.- For all the features lost with this new Kindle, you’d expect the new screen to be larger than it is. Actually it’s the same width as the old one and a tiny, tiny fraction of an inch longer (almost indecipherable).- For reading purposes, have not noticed much difference between this supposed ""Glare-Free"" display and my older Kindle. Even reading in the car on a sunny day, there's not much difference. You can see more of a glare in the photo I added, but who regularly has that amount of light shining on the screen?I have another 2 months to decide whether or not to return it. Since it was bought for me as a gift, I’m disinclined to do this. And if I’m using it primarily to read, it works – except for the highlighting, which I used frequently on my old Kindle. I consider this an inferior facsimile. I hope this is not another case of Amazon sacrificing features for the sake of profit."
"23","A total piece of junk"
"24","This was just a long drawn out sexual book.  poorly written in my opinion.  I deleted it from my kindle.  The author needs a lot of help!"
"25","OUT OF 5 BOOKS I PURCHASED ONLINE, 3 ARE NOT COMPATIBLE SO I CAN'T USE IT!.  PLUS, IT FLOODS YOU WITH PROPAGANDA.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
"26","I am very happy with this purchase other than the fact it didn't come with a wall charger. I am using my Nokia 520 phone wall charger with this Kindle 6"". As you can see this Kindle uses a micro connecter, which most cell phones use.The screen is a light gray and the text is clear. It doesn't have any back lighting, speakers or headphone jack. This Kindle has a touch screen. You will have to go through the ""difficult"" task of swiping your finger across the screen to turn pages. If you have shakiness or tremors this in not the Kindle for you as it would cause you a lot of frustration. If you are new to the Kindle world be aware that there is a learning curve. The users guide answers most questions. If  you are stuck and can't figure out what to do call the kindle customer service. There is no  phone number only this online site address. They are great to work with.https://www.google.com/search?site=&source=hp&q=kindle+customer+service&oq=kindle+&gs_l=hp.1.1.35i39l2j0i20j0l2j0i20j0l4.1928.3915.0.7564.8.8.0.0.0.0.347.1416.2-3j2.5.0.msedr...0...1c.1.62.hp..4.4.1102.0.C94OtxssNOAIf you have books on your computer, unless they are Epub files The Kindle should be able to handle most files. Nook uses Epub (files) and Kindle uses Mobi (files) I easily transfered most of my books from my computer to the kindle smoothly with out a hitch. FYI you can not transfer entire folders only the files in side of them. I would definitely recommend the Kindle 6""."
"27","Didn't like that one looking for another"
"28","I wish I had bought a Kindle sooner. Let me preface this by mentioning that when a family member got a 4th Generation Kindle about 2 years ago, I could not figure out how to use it. The small buttons and no keyboard drove me crazy trying to type in what I wanted, trying to navigate on the Kindle screen to purchase or find books, and downloading books. I found the page turn buttons to be annoying and it was too easy to accidentally press them while reading. I couldn't figure out where to put my hand to hold the Kindle while avoiding the page turn buttons.The Kindle touch has changed all of that. It's easy to navigate and easy to type because it's all touch responsive. You don't have to worry about turning the page unless you touch your finger to the screen, and because of this, turning the page is really easy. Built into the Kindle interface, I can hold my finger on a word I don't know and it will give me a definition of that word in my choice of 2 dictionaries. The lack of buttons on the bottom gives you ample space to place your thumb to grasp the Kindle, and the same for the edges on the left and right of the screen, to rest your finger of the same hand for stabilization. To make things even easier, I purchased Popsockets to put on the back so I can hold it with a flat hand.My only caveat is that there is no light, which I knew before purchasing, but the screen is somewhat darker than expected. It's not as bright as a piece of paper in front of you, it's a shade or two dimmer. In daylight or indoors, this is not a problem, but if you read in bed at night with a low watt lamp next to you, you're going to want the screen to be brighter. If I could turn the light off completely on the Voyager, I would have opted for that one in retrospect.Things I like: Touch screen No buttons Easy to navigate and type because of the touch screen Space to grasp due to no buttons Small power button on the bottomThings I don't like: The screen is dimmer than expected and has no light to compensate. Only comes with a USB cord to charge off of your computer, no wall plug. I use the base from the iphone charger with the Kindle USB. The lack of a charging base is clearly a way for Amazon to earn extra money when you purchase the wall plug, but if you want to look at it from a positive perspective, for the many who refuse to pay extra money for the wall plug, providing only the USB cord is ecofriendly and minimizing technological waste being sent to Guiyu, China, the e-waste recycling hub of the world, to be recycled when we no longer want our used electronics. (Children and adults alike in the city of Guiyu are getting sick from lead poisoning and various other ailments from the toxicity of the air, water, and direct exposure to heavy metals from inside our electronics). The ads and having to pay $20 to remove them is cheap marketing, where Amazon is profiting off of you seeing the ads, and profiting off of you not wanting to see them. Clever, but not classy.Unknowns:How easily does the screen dent? Does it need a screen protector or a hard case to protect the screen?Update 7 months later: I still LOVE my kindle. I had no idea I would ever love it this much. I don't go anywhere without it."
"29","I've owned 5 Kindles now.  The first one the battery would no longer charge.  The second one I dropped and the corner turned black which interfered with reading.  The third one I had sitting on the bed and accidentally leaned on and it separated from the frame and wouldn't work anymore.  And this one is the fourth one.  I've since ordered a ""used like new"" Kindle like my second and third one because I hate this one so much I won't use it anymore.  Let me explain one thing.  I love new electronics.  While everyone is complaining about how it used to work fine I'm excited to see what they changed because more than not, I love it.  Not so this Kindle. First off I can't even begin to express how cheaply made this Kindle is.  It's light alright.  Because it's made out of cheap, cheap, cheap plastic. I can just envision it cracking with the slightest bang. I thought the idea of the touch screen was a great idea.  And no more typing on the tiny keyboard on the bottom that was designed for little mouse feet?  Wonderful.  Uh.....no.  While the keyboard is fantastic the problem is with the touch screen in general.  There are no longer tabs on the side to turn your page forwards and backwards.  Instead page turning is done by lifting your finger and tapping or swiping a certain area on the Kindle.  Half the time it's unresponsive and doesn't turn the page.  The other half it's either turning it in the wrong direction (and yes, I am smart enough to tap it in the correct spot).  I can't express how frustrating and annoying this is. And if you're like me and read in bed, I lay on my left side and hold the Kindle with my right hand.  When they had the tabs on both sides, backwards and forwards was equally accessible.  Now, if you have the Kindle in your right hand and want to go back a page you must reach all the way across to the other side of the page to tap the small area designated for turning the page back.  On the other hand (literally) if you're on your right side and turning with your left, you have to reach across to tap the area to move forward and try and avoid the area designated for backwards.  And half the time you're turning the page in the wrong direction. And if you are like me and like larger print, you are constantly lifting your thumb to tap the page to turn it. It also randomly changes your font.  And God forbid you need to lay it down during use and you happen to touch the screen or your cat walks on it.  When you come back to read it's either highlighted a word and the dictionary is up or it's changed your font or you're on a page that you didn't leave it on.  I just plain hate it.  I see the new Kindle now has page sensors on the side similar to the original ones.  I must assume from this that I am not the only one who hates this design.  I was thinking of purchasing one of those but they don't look ""ready for primetime either"".  There are a multitude of complaints that they had a two-toned colored screen. And the ""touch screen"" on this one reminds me of an old Pantech phone I had that was supposed to have a touch screen like a smartphone.  No, no, no. Not even close.  It's not responsive like a touch screen should be.  It lags and is super frustrating. So I just spent 79$ on this piece of garbage and I really don't want to invest another $200 in something else that will aggravate the hell out of me. So now I ended up buying an old Kindle for $83.00.  Not happy with this at all.UPDATE:  I contacted Amazon and got a full refund with no hassles. I'll be sending it back shortly. And I got my new ""old"" Kindle today and am soooo happy.  What a relief.  I just hope it lasts until Amazon can figure out that we don't want to do gymnastics to turn pages and would like to be able to actually touch the screen of our Kindle to lay it down without it spazzing out."
"30","I am totally for touch screen and totally okay without light. But why no one ever mention there is delay in responding to practically every command and the screen ""flashes"" (turns black before it shows the new page) whenever you switch page, which I found very annoying but mostly because the delay? Is it just me? Did I get a defective product?I don't care about touch screen and light. But I really can't put up with such slow machine."
"31","We didn't receives the charger head ! Would you pls mail it to us !"
"32","What can I say, IT'S A KINDLE!!! It's one of the BEST e-book readers on the market!  It has more features than any of the others and very fast when loading!  This is my 3rd Kindle and I have never been disappointed with any of my Kindle's performance!  If anything they inspire me to want to read even more!  This Kindle is light in weight and the price is truly unbeatable especially since I purchased this one when it was discounted at $59!  You will not be disappointed in this e-reader!"
"33","I hate having a touch screen!!!!"
"34","No instructions given. Limited explanation of product. Can't change (or figure out how to change) the lighting. Can't read it unless lots of light."
"35","piece  of junk unable to  set up  account letters too small threw in trash"
"36","I ordered this for my 90-year old father who has had 2 Kindles other to date.  This was to replace his previous version, which after a year experienced some sensitivity and irregularity in page keys.  This Touchscreen version did not work out at all for him; he would accidentally hit the screen, end up pulling up a menu/task bar and lost in how to find his way back to his book.  The instructions are too cryptic and assume an advanced user- therefore no help for him (or me.)He just wants a simple way to read a book via Kindle-- I gave him the one I bought 4 years ago and it still does the trick.  Forget all the bells and whistles."
"37","I didn't NEED a new Kindle. I have a keyboard Kindle that works quite well. But I began to see the ads for this one and, after reading about it, comparing it to the others, and seeing how affordable it was, I decided that it would be a good thing to have. My son is an avid reader and is always asking for books for  his birthday or Christmas. My justification for buying a new Kindle was this ... if I get a new one and keep the old one in my name, then when I buy a new book, he'll also be able to read it. So instead of buying him a new book, I have given him approximately 250 books, including his favorite author, Stephen King, and the ability to read many more. I'm also impressed with this new one. It's easy to handle, easy to read, compact but not phone size. Now I'm just waiting for the new cover for it so I can pack it around with me. Yep, I'm happy!"
"38","I purchased this Kindle for my father after he broke his Kindle Keyboard. He used his Kindle now and then and after talking with him we decided on this version instead of one more expensive.Very quickly we discovered something rather upsetting which took nearly an hour of online digging to confirm: it has no speakers. My dad started collecting audio books and would listen to them at night. No where on the product page does it state there are no speakers. Had I known this before I would have gone with a PaperWhite, which I myself own.Both of us have struggled with this Kindle's touchscreen. I use touchscreens all day long, including a PaperWhite, with no problems. There are delays between tapping and the reaction at times which prompts you to double tap.Besides these two things the Kindle works as advertised.I would like to see Amazon drop the current shape and material for the slimmer, more rounded design they used before. While I wouldn't count that as a negative it is not a positive either."
"39","I previous had the Kindle Keyboard and was devastated when after 5 years of use the screen had some major issues that couldn't be fixed. Please note I travel constantly and even though I always kept it in a case it definitely had some tough love but worked great up until the end.The new kindle has the same great screen without glare.  It's easy to navigate to order books, use the dictionary while reading, highlight quotes in books and set up wifi(however it was easier to turn it on and off on the Kindle Keyboard interface).The one major downside to the new Kindle is the touchscreen sensitivity.  I frequently read in bed and if my blanket grazes the screen it changes pages, font size or resets me to the beginning of the my book.  There's no adjustability that I'm aware of in the settings and every night when I read I miss the buttons to turn the pages."
"40","Dont like to write low review for a kindle,I got this on Prime Day, I like the new Goodreads linked accounts, also the size of this one! But, for some reason I couldn't access the Lending Library. After looking in different Blogs, Amazon videos and so on. I decided to call Customer Service... First person, really nice, did everything she could, but no success. Then she passed my call to another area. the person that was trying to help me, was treating me like a mor*on, she kept insinuating that I was doing wrong the things she was telling me, and she kept ""Breathing Hard"" in a ways of saying ""i can’t believe you can’t see that"". I told her few times, I can send you a picture of the screen and you will see the “All Collections” button is not here. But she kept with the attitude. At one moment I told her something like, “you been insinuating that I can’t follow simple instructions and you don’t get to understand that the link is not here” also she made me do the same thing few times. They kept me 1:30hr “Maybe More” on the phone, and when she finally decided that It was time to do something else and replace the Kindle, she told me that because I was not living in US they had to ship my Kindle to a different address in FL. (My Grandmas) WHAT?. This got shipped to PR and has to be sent back to PR. (that’s what a think should happen) And she kept telling me that FL was the best option. YEAH, for you! But if I had agreed, who was going to pay me that shipping from US to PR? ME! Anyways, she finally found a way to do it, but after a 1:30, her attitude, and the “Yeah because you don’t live in the US. they should send me an upgrade of the Kindle with a “Thank you for being a customer note”!! I am a HAPPY PRIME member and buy almost everything at Amazon I tell everyone I know how gorgeous Amazon and PRIME are, but mad at the service I received, this is no way of treating a customer!"
"41","I never received my order. I needed it for my textbooks and probably will fail the classes which cost $2500"
"42","I did not realize that this Kindle did not have a lighted screen.  I would really like ti exchange it."
"43","The item arrived on time however I brought this item thinking It was like a tablet my young daughter has know use for it and I really want to get my money back our a tablet My daughter turn it on and it's in black and white and she immediately turned it off.."
"44","I can't figure how to transfer books from my old kindle into my new one"
"45","This isn't so much a review of the product, which is fine, so much as a review of Amazon's advertising. I received an email from them telling all the features of their new Kindle Voyage, and boy, did it sound great. The whole email was all about it with pictures of only the Voyage. Then at the bottom of the email is a large button that said, ""Buy the new Kindle for $79."" So, my birthday was coming up so I forwarded the email to my wife. She thought it looked great and ordered it. It shows up around my birthday and we're both wondering why it's thicker than the ad and what happened to the backlight. Go back to the email ad and see that the Kindle she ordered is just called ""Kindle"" but the more expensive models, like the Voyage ($200), have names. To us, they are all Kindles. I wasn't about to send it back, cause it is pretty neat, but I have to read at night with the light on. In closing, Amazon, you get one star for sh***ty advertising."
"46","Not what I expected. Like size. Hate I can't read at night. Will like it outside reading . Should have read small print."
"47","This is the most disappointing product I have ever purchased from Amazon and I am hoping there is some exchange policy in place because I absolutely detest this product and am extremely disappointed"
"48","I got my Kindle 6' glee free screen as a gift and I Love it."
"49","Would give this negative stars if I could.First of all you have to load the books from your cloud account one at a time, and I have over 1000 books so it took 12 hours. Even loading it in 10 book blocks takes that long. They really should find some way to assist customers with this but just say ""Sorry"" if you ask.Second, I found that my ""Active content"" GAMES would not download to this new 7th Generation Kindle so I called to see where to find the Games for this generation. I thought perhaps I would have to switch to Aps like the Fire instead of the Active Content, or something like that.  YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS!  The 7th Gen ""New"" Kindle DOES NOT DO GAMES OR ACTIVE CONTECT OR APS OR ANYTHING!  JUST BOOKS AND DOCUMENTS!  My 4th Gen even does Active Content!Apparently this 7th Gen Kindle is not as ""Evolved"" as the 4th Generation that I have been using for 2 years. To be honest it looks and sounds just like the old ""Touch"" that they dropped over a year ago for being too behind the times. They say it isn't but it works the same way and has the same limitations. But, even the Touch did Active Content for Games, etc.Anyway...look out...I just got stuck and can't return it fast enough. This leaves me with a dying 4th Gen and no where to go, but somehow a ""downgrade"" just is not going to do it."
"50","I received the Amazon Kindle on the release date of October 2.  Thus far I have been very happy with it.  I have the Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD and have been pleased with them.  However, I wanted something that was more exclusively an e-reader with the glare-free screen that I could take with me on the go for reading.  I have my smartphone with me when I am out or at work so bringing a Kindle Fire with me seemed redundant.  I also rationalized my purchase of yet another Kindle by the fact that when I read on my other Kindles, I am easily distracted by the other apps and end up spending too much time with those rather than enjoying reading.I like the screen and the size.  I find it much easier to read than my other Kindles, even with their matte screen protectors.  The touchscreen is a nice addition with this version.  I am used to this with my other Kindles so it is an easy transition.I also like that you can organize your books.  That is something that I had longed for with my other Kindles.  I think it will be nice to file away the books that I have read and the books to be read.  I can think of all kinds of possibilities for this feature.  I had been considering the previous generation, which I think was $69 as opposed to $79 and I am glad that I waited.I may update when I have had the product longer."
"51","I had the kindle a generation before this one which I loved, but it broke one day after a friend sat on it... I thought that the new generation could only be better, but I was wrong. The last generation was thinner and lighter. Though this generation is still pretty light, its heavy enough for me to feel that itd slip when only holding it with one hand. (Granted I have small hands.) Also, the black framing looks thicker and the screen looks smaller. I feel that the touchscreen is unnecessary for a simple ereader, especially if you use it mainly for reading and not for taking notes, which is what I do. I loved the buttons on the side used to change pages in the previous version, but they have been changed to swiping. The layout of the home page, etc is more cluttered now if I'm remembering my old kindle correctly. It might be weird that I'm complaining about it having more functions, but I feel that a kindle ereader should stay simple and do its job: be as portable as possible, be efficient to use, and show me my books. Anything else is superfluous and you might as well buy a tablet."
"52","Got it today as promised.  Was not sure if I would like the touch screen Kindle.  I've had Kindle with a keyboard since 6-7 years.  The initial impression is it is really good.  Found it easy to read and the controls are easy to use. The books got synced up in minutes once I logged in. Now to get a cover for it."
"53","I am disappointed; I can't adjust the brightness of the screen like I can do on my paperwhite. My own fault for not realizing this before I ordered it."
"54","I hate it.!! Can't make it work,,...Returning it.!!!"
"55","I bought a Kindle Voyage, and I absolutely hate this device. It is the most user-unfriendly piece of electronic equipment I have ever tried to use. I will probably never use it again after having tried to read through two books on it. What a waste of money!"
"56","Do not buy this $79 dollar boat anchor! Matter of fact, it would probably float, so is all around useless. I don't often read, just wanted something light and easy to learn to play the piano on. A piano in my pocket, you know? Well, all Amazon piano apps are INCOMPATIBLE with this AMAZON device. Sorry I wasted my money. Don't make the same mistake I did!"
"57","I have been very disappointed with my new Kindle 6"" Glare-Free e reader.  I loved my old one and sorry it died.... There are many times when it doesn't take actions as needed.  i.e., page turning, scrolling up or down.  It will simply do nothing or, to my frustration, if your finger is near the page it will jump and sometimes it takes several minutes to find where you were.  It seems to me that in this case, progress has taken a big step backwards in this new edition.  I'm not very happy and would not recommend it.  You need to improve this reader or remove it....Bobbie"
"58","Very nice book reader. Also comes with promotional Unlimited Reading ability to get any book from the list for a month.What is a bit annoying in the amazon interface is that if you click buy, even mistakenly, then the purchase is made without any explicit confirmation or password"
"59","This is my first Kindle, but I've been using the Kindle app on my Samsung Galaxy Note II for quite some time. Initially, I held out on buying any kind of e-reader. I enjoy the feel of a paperback in my hands. However, I am in many Lit classes and the cost of books has been piling up. When this Kindle went on sale for $59, I decided I could finally justify buying this ""non-essential"" item. I only got it yesterday, but I am so glad that I have it now. The screen is crisp and clear. I prefer it much more than reading on the Kindle app, probably because it is not back lit, so it is easy on the eyes. The battery seems to last forever. I stayed up hours reading last night. If I had been on my phone, I would've needed to plug it into the charger long before I wanted to stop reading. Though page turns are smoother on the app, turning pages on my Kindle doesn't jar me out of my reading experience at all. Some people complain about a lack of buttons for page turning, but I don't see the need for them since this Kindle is touchscreen. I'm already used to tapping to turn pages on the app, so, in this, the two are exactly the same. Additionally, I love the size. It's bigger than my phone, but not cumbersome, so it's easy to read lying in bed (with a bedside lamp on, of course). The only thing remotely negative that I can say isn't even about the Kindle itself; it's about the need to separately purchase a power adapter. Don't waste your money on the official Kindle adapter. I purchased a universal USB power adapter for $6 that works just as well; there's no need to spend $20 on it. If you have a cell phone charger that uses an adapter, you don't really even need to buy one at all; I only did for convenience sake. All in all, I am extremely happy with my purchase."
"60","This Kindle is a replacement for my Kindle Keyboard, which bit the dust a couple of weeks ago.  I loved my previous Kindle model.  I loathe the new one.  With a burning hatred I find hard to contain.  The touchscreen is the MOST annoying thing ever.  However, if you've never used a non-touchscreen Kindle, you may have a different opinion.With my previous Kindle, I could hold the device anywhere and not lose my place in the book. If it slipped in my hands, grabbing it anywhere was OK.  With this one, ANY light touch to the screen changes something.  My ponytail accidentally touched it and some stupid window to change text size popped up.  I've lost count of the number of times it has jumped ahead several pages when I only tapped the screen once.The reason I purchased a replacement Kindle instead of using my iPad is because it's smaller, lighter and better on the battery.  But this Kindle sucks.  I miss the buttons to change the page, to go ""Home"" or ""Back"" or turn Wi-Fi on/off.  With my previous Kindle, I could hold it in my left hand while I ate lunch.  My right hand could hold a fork while my left hand could change the page.  Not with this one.  You have to tap the right side of the screen to jump ahead.  My thumb isn't 8"" long so it doesn't reach the right side.So I will take apart my old Kindle to try to fix it because I'm this close to playing Frisbee with the new one.  If that fails, well, I don't know what I'll do but I'll still hate the new Kindle.  This will never change.  But I miss the buttons.  I'm tired of jumping through hoops for functionality that was once available with one key.  There's too much tapping for me."
"61","very disappointed.  the kindle itself is easy to use and nice.  bought it after noticing that books i wanted to read are available on amazon.com.  several purchases later i received a threatning letter from amazon"
"62","Love the smaller design had the previous keyboard kindle. Chose the touch because I like the long battery life of my previous one. This one would have got 5 stars if 1st it had the nice screen savers like my previous one and 2nd if it had text to speech like the kindle keyboard. I love reading on a Kindle they are awesome devices . I cried when I lost my kindle keyboard had it been my ipad I would not have been that upset."
"63","I like that this kindle has a touch screen and everything except for one annoying thing works as it should. Sometimes without warning, the text will change to a smaller or larger font without me touching the screen at all, and I have to change it back. Irritating bug."
"64","The screen has touch aspects similar to those of the Fires, which are nice. However, the screen and the font are not as clear as my old kindle keyboard, and it therefore hurts my eyes. Overall, I was very disappointed in it.  I nearly returned it, but kept it in case my keyboard died."
"65","I have used my 3rd generation Kindle keyboard since it was launched and I recently bought this one for my brother. I still use my Kindle keyboard, but after trying this one, the old girl is now feeling a little slow and little washed-out and I'm thinking of upgrading to the paperwhite soon. I don't imagine many of you are first-time Kindle users, and many may be wondering if the latest Kindles are worth the upgrade. I wondered the same myself and I'm just here to tell you that after using it, I'm now convinced that the better refresh-rate, contrast, blacker blacks and whiter whites and lighter weight are worth an upgrade.Kindle units in general have changed my life for the better and I have totally forgiven Amazon for losing $9k on their stock back when I was younger. Thank you Amazon."
"66","Lousy. Cant download audio books. Need help or want to return."
"67","i purchased this item on and it went on sale 2 days later..."
"68","Not at all satisfied thought I was buying a kindle white."
"69","The Kindle did not have audio book capability as advertised. We will be returning the product in the near future."
"70","I sent it back as it was horrid. I have a good Kindle Fire that I read everyh day but this was a joke. Should be take off the market at Amazon."
"71","free books are bad, and books are expensive!"
"72","EtIguf"
"73","I should have read the description better.....no back light......perfect!"
"74","I love carrying this lightweight kindle and reading books.  I have a Kindle Fire, but it is so much heavier.  That is the reason that I ordered this.  I have so  many books in it to read ; and yet, it is lighter than carrying a paperback book."
"75","I love this kindle.  I also own aFire HDX 8.9"", but I wanted a plain Kindle for just reading. This feels much lighter than my HDX and it is thinner.I am having trouble getting used to the feel of it in my hand but I will eventually.  I wanted to write this review because I am a person with dyslexia and I love that I can change the font and size of the print to accommodate those BayeSian having more difficulty reading. This model comes with the Futura font which is easiest for me to read. I wish that all Kindles and Fires offered all fonts.  I can not get this font on the HDX yet.  I have talked to customer service and it may be in an update but I don't understand why all the fonts aren't universal to all Kindles.Anyway, I love this Kindle. Yes, you need a lighted area to read in and you need Wi-Fi to download material. If you do not have Wi-Fi yourself, go to your local library or a McDonald's.  I did that with my first reader and that kept me going for 2 years.  Once I needed internet for college, I invested in Wi-Fi. As someone else mentioned, this is a great introductory Kindle.  I got mine during the Black Friday sales and it was under 70 dollars.  If you want a beginning reader for your children, you may want to get the Kindle he 6.  If your child is past picture books, then this Kindle is for you. Compare before you buy and you won't be disappointed."
"76","I bought this one to replace the 4-year old one that finally died. The screen size is the same but they changed to dimensions of the outer frame just enough I couldn't use the protective case from the old one. There are a couple of minor differences in the controls but otherwise much the same."
"77","I love it. I read fast and enjoy having the full control of size, font & alignment. How I like to read my letters just speeds up the reading time. The fast access to dictionary is amazingly beneficial for easier & faster learning. I only regret not buying it sooner."
"78","I am really enjoying my Kindle. I already had a Kindle Fire HD, however, it strained my eyes too much to read at night. The size is perfect to carry around with me. And, I have to be honest here, I'm a big Star Trek geek, and the Kindle reader reminds of the PADD device on that show."
"79","I will be returning asap"
"80","Turned it on day, the page was half title page and half place where I had stopped reading the night before.  Lost several good books including two I haven't read.  This was not mishandled, either!  I am ready to go back to paper!"
"81","I returned it."
"82","I highly recommend never buying one of these. I got this for Christmas and about a year and 4 month later I go an error message that read: Kindle Needs Repair. I called Amazon and they told me the device was dead and there was nothing they can do. They offered me a ""discount"" for a refurbished one which was actually more than if I just ordered a new on from their website. I babied this product. I had it in a hard case and only charged when the battery was very low. The book stayed on my night stand 24/7, so it was never abused out in the world.  I only read about 10 books on the device. I won't ever be buying one of these again since Amazon won't back thier product for more than a year."
"83","You read, you need a kindle! There is nothing like a kindle for reading. I have own every kindle there is and have tried every other reader around. My choice for reading is the plain and simple kindle. Yes I like the paper white and the fancy voyage for the back light and higher resolution. But there is something special in the plain kindle 6, it just feels and reads more like a book."
"84","I got this thing as a refurb and it's basically brand new. I can see nothing that would suggest much use for sure. No problems with the screen as of now and the touch mechanism to me is working perfectly. Updating the thing was a breeze. So let's get into detail on the device...The normal Kindle I suppose is the poor man's e-reader at this point in Amazon's lineup. But I am waiting until the 16nm tablet revolution to get one of their high-end tablets. I didn't want to pay more than I needed for something that I just read text on, and the paperwhite seems to have its fair share of screen problems. This one was only 64 dollars base price. I got a used case to go along with it.For that price the device is positively charming. It's my first Kindle and I really could not ask for more. Amazon's software if very mature at this point, so you have a variety of fonts, readability settings, and core attributes to modify to your liking. After a couple minor fixes for my own personal use I was off downloading my entire Kindle on PC library. Easy. Fast. I could not ask for anything easier. The experimental browser also gets the job done. Bookmarks and decent website compatibility as long as it doesn't use too much Flash or Java. The device works perfectly for a college accessory and textbook device when needed.Not all textbooks are compatible with the lower end devices though. That was the only downside to the cheapest one in the lineup. My Glossary of Literary Terms was sadly not okay with this e-reader.Navigating and using features like highlights, x-ray, dictionaries, and the page functions took about 20 minutes for me to get the hang of it all. Again, everything is set up to help the customer get up and running very easily. The various swipes are easy to remember and incredibly intuitive at this point. I can flip, preview, cancel, and just all around enjoy the book I am reading without hardly any hassle at all. I for one did not think the page turning was too sensitive on mine. Seems about right for such a device. Amazon clearly has some very mature software here that complements the Kindle hardware in synergistic fashion.I don't use too many of the community features like Goodreads, but that is there for you too if you want to be involved in the gigantic Kindle community. Other great community functions that are less pervasive include notes on what people highlighted in the book, which I found to be a nice feature. And then you have other functions like about the book, which gives you some really nice info about what you are reading the first time.The one thing some people are going to not like is probably the storage. 4GBs is not really what I call enough space for the future. Luckily, I do have a lot of Delphi collections and my books fit on here nicely at this point. I have about 2.3GBs left after DL'ing 70 or so products. Amazon itself has its own helpful user guide for you to DL right off the bat, so if you do ever get lost that thing should save you a lot of time.The resolution of the display seems fine to me and very close to what you would get in a normal sized book. The somewhat dim display works very well for and is basically about the brightness of a normal literature page. I was comparing it to a bunch of my books and came away quite pleased with what they have here. Of course a bit more resolution would be nice, but for what is here you can still get fairly small fonts and good detail. This is not a reader for the dark, obviously.Anyway, I don't think there is too much else to say. I'll update the review as I go along, and take a note on battery life, but for now this thing is a great little device. Cheap, fast, easy to use, and all around a nice product to own with good and simple build quality. It sync'd up with my Amazon account right away and there was absolutely zero trouble getting this thing to work correctly. Highly recommended to those on a budget or to those that do not have any need for the higher-end tablets and readers. Unlike some of the other products, this one doesn't have any inherent screen issues, either."
"85","After using this for over a month I've come to hold the opinion that the older Kindle models were much better.  I like to write notes, lists, etc. while I read and now that Amazon has disabled active content, I have to keep pen and paper near at hand.  I also like to read outside, or rather, I used to.  The touchscreen can be triggered by flies, so when I set my kindle down for a minute I often find I've lost my place because a fly had landed on the screen.  There are a few other quirks that are mildly annoying.  On the positive side, the battery life is good.  I wouldn't waste your money on this device, you'd be better off buying a cheap Android tablet and running the Kindle app on it.Update: The update issued in early 2016 has made the device defective.  After 1 hour, 46 minutes with support, they acknowledged the defect and I was told there was nothing they could do.  Basically, the made my device defective then refused to repair or replace it.  This company seems to have shifted from caring about whether or not you were satisfied with your purchase to getting every last penny they can out of you."
"86","Well, those of us who despise touch screens are now officially out of luck.  Glad I saw this coming.  Hopefully, my old Kindles last for a few more years.  Then I'll just go elsewhere."
"87","It came with absolutely no whatsoever.Pathetic!"
"88","This is my 6th Kindle.  I liked all of the previous models better that this one.  The touch screen drives me crazy (it is way too sensitive), as  the slightest hint of contact makes something, mostly unwanted, happen.  Either it goes back a page, forward a page, changes font size or goes to a menu or function that I don't want .  I've been forced to return my previous Kindle to service even though it has reached a stage where it locks up occasionally and the screen is losing it's crispness (both reasons that I replaced it with this one).  Not sure what I'm going to do about this.  I am an avid read, and travel a lot and have come to be completely hooked on this type of vehicle for my library.  The e-reader is the answer to easy reading, but I sure like the older (non touch-screen) models better.  It's not that I don't use touch screen technology--I have smart phones and tablets, etc, that I use daily without problems, but I like to and need to be able to treat my e-reader like a book, and this one won't let me do that."
"89","I'm disappointed that I've lost my bookmarks and highlights on the 300 or so books that I had on my old Kindle as well as syncing to furtherest point read. This device would be fine for someone just starting out with a Kindle, but frustrating for an existing user. At this point, I'm reading new books on the new device and I'm reading my older books on my old Kindle. There may be a way of fixing my problem with bookmarks, etc., but if so, it doesn't happen automatically. I do like that it's lighter than my old Kindle."
"90","I like the touch screen but in all honesty would give it up in a heartbeat for the battery life these used to have,  I went from charging my old one once a month to charging this one almost every day.  I don't expect it to last more than a year because rechargeable batteries have a limit how many time they can be charged, most of them 500 times.  When the battery is gone I will probably switch to reading on the kindle app on my phone.  To be honest I don't even use this that much and the wifi is never on unless I am downloading something.  I don't suspect that this would even last an hour between charge for most people."
"91","My dad has always has a passion for reading. Due to macular degeneration he is losing his sight and gave up on reading. I thought why not try a kindle, I was afraid it would be to techy for him and since he lives in another state I wouldn't be able to assist him.  Well he loves it. He reads one to two books a day. I know because his kindle is linked to my account so I have been paying for them. I don't have the heart to tell him so I will continue to pay for them. He did pay for all my books while I was growing up and I got my love for books from him so is a small price to pay. If you have someone in your life with low vision try a kindle. My dad calls at least once a week to thank me and it's been six months."
"92","-- Pros --1. Since the Kindle PaperWhite is only a fraction of an inch smaller than this Kindle, then this product can fit into a PaperWhite case as long as it's not a snap-in case (which is really handy because it's almost impossible to find cases for this one.  See Con #1).  It's a bit snug and the auto on/off won't work because the PaperWhite mechanism is different, but at least it fits.  Amazon itself has made cases that fit this kindle, but as far as I know there's only about 6.2. Pretty much everything advertised.3. I can go on my library website and borrow kindle books for free.  Works so easily and I've used it several times.  Just get a library card from your local or main branch and find your library on Overdrive.com (At least, that's the site my library is on.  Just ask a librarian if yours is different).-- Cons --1. Like I mentioned before, it's almost impossible to find a case specifically for this Kindle.  Why?  Because it's only called ""Kindle.""  And all the other Kindle models -- whether it be Fire, Paper White, Voyage, Touch, or another -- are also called ""Kindle.""  All these models (especially Fire, which is also in its 7th generation) are significantly more popular than this very good though rather badly titled model.  Therefore, it is impossible to find the very few accessories for this Kindle while they drown helplessly amid the several hundred results for the Kindle Anything-Else-But-This-One. ;)  Like I mentioned; it's a very good product.  It's just fallen victim of a rather obvious but still painfully detrimental marketing misstep.2. It glitches every once in a while if I try to push too many buttons, and then I loose info like how many ages I read in FreeTime that day, but that's pretty rare.3. The battery only lasts weeks if you keep it on Airplane mode, which is usually fine because it really only uses internet when you're shopping.***6 MONTH UPDATE***Con #2 is becoming a bit more prevalent.  What does the glitch look like?  Well, the Kindle stops responding without for a few seconds.  I usually notice when I go to turn a page and nothing happens.  A moment later the screen spasms in a display of black-and-white rectangles before going white.  Another moment, and I see the ""loading up"" screen, which is a picture of a boy sitting under a tree with a progress bar in the foreground.  After about 10-20 seconds, everything is normal except for the fact that it's forgotten my page number and has returned me to the spot I left off the day before.My Kindle glitches several times a week (I use it every day) and it almost invariably looses my place in whatever book I'm reading.  It's not that big of a deal to find my place again, but it is a bit disappointing."
"93","Poorly made! lacks durability!  If you buy one expect to need a replacement every year orso."
"94","very poor quality.  would appreciate a complete refund!!!"
"95","i dont know how to operate it.there is no instruction.please advise.its not going anywhere"
"96","i did not receive the Kindle. It has been three months I am so angry about this!"
"97","Package was not delivered on time when it was garenteed it would be"
"98","I've been an avid reader from the moment I first learned to read. This means over the years I have collected tons of books. Sure I've downsize plenty of times, gave books away to friends or donations but still somehow before I knew it I once again has too many books and no place to store new ones. It was a vicious cycle. So I as much as I was against them, I decided to get an e-reader.I originally had a nook color and that was my first introduction into e-readers. It was great for graphic novels and comics but not so much for actual novels. My eyes would hurt and strain from the back light and text. I also hated reading outside on a bright sunny day since all I would experience was glare. While for the most part I was happy with it (I could play games on it!) I was also extremely unhappy. Eventually my nook suffered extreme water damage, so I was then in the market for a new e-reader. I tried to save myself some money by reading on my iPad but I encountered the same problems as I did with the nook. Painful, strained eyes from the back light when reading for prolonged times and of course the dreaded sunny day glare (which those of us with iPads know that glare pretty much renders them useless since you cannot see a thing), plus my iPad is a bulky 2nd generation and because of the weight it gets pretty tiring holding that thing for a lengthy time reading. Because of my inability to comfortably read, I started buying physical books again... and once again ran out of room to store them.I started doing my research on some basic e-readers (such as the Kindle, Kindle Paperwhite and the Nook Glowlight). I didn't want one of the tablet e-readers since I already had an iPad, so why do I need all the bells and whistles? So, I compared each of the ereaders I was interested in and the Nook Glowlight was originally winning the race, since I had a whole library of ebooks purchased from Barnes and Noble from my previous device and the price was excellent. 100 bucks for basically the BN version of the Kindle Paperwhite. It was cheaper than buying the Paperwhite from Amazon... but then prime day happened.A basic Kindle (with special offers) for 50 bucks? SOLD!I had heard of the pricing when sales had leaked a few days before prime day and I told a few people I knew I was buying a Kindle. My husband pointed out a few things such as ""There is no backlight"" - Well the backlight was my main issue with my previous e-reader and my iPad so no backlight? No problem! ""What about your previous Barnes and Noble library?"" - I already read them all, I'll buy new books. Again, No problem! ""What if you want to read in the dark?"" - I turn on a light! Problem solved! and last but not least ""Don't you think the special offers will get annoying?"" - Nope, in fact something might catch my eye and it will serve more like a recommendation on what to read next. I had it all figured out. I was buying a Kindle.The day my Kindle came, I was so excited that I immediately set it up. I took advantage of a trial month of Kindle Unlimited so I started reading right away. I am beyond thrilled I made this purchase. The Kindle so far has lived up to my every expectation (granted I have only had the device for 5 days). I have no issues with my eyes hurting or straining while reading. I have been able to take advantage of a breezy summer day by reading in my backyard without an issue of glare from the sun. The photo I've included with my review is the clearness of the screen outside on a sunny day. I was so impressed with the lack of glare, I immediately took a picture with intentions of adding it to this review. The weight of the Kindle is practically nothing, so it doesn't become annoying holding it for a prolonged reading session. I'm also very impressed with the battery life. I've been reading daily for about an hour or so each day and I haven't needed to charge my Kindle yet (except for the initial charging when it arrived). I also love the ability to use amazon household to share libraries. My husband uses the Kindle app on his tablet so I am able to read what he reads on my kindle.I am extremely happy to have bought a Kindle which originally I would have never done so if it hadn't gone on sale during prime day. But I will admit that would have been so foolish because even at 79 dollars The Kindle (with special offers) is worth every penny."
"99","No flip page buttons, no options for orientation. no charger, no support for active content, lower quality finish... A good value only at $49 during Black Friday.The touch screen is ok, although is easier to skip pages unintentionally. Easier to use the on-screen keyboard with touch than with the ""joystick"" of the previous version.Different dimension then the previous version, so a new cover is required - not from Amazon though, they are charging nearly as much for the cover as for the device! - and the same goes for the charger.Speaking of dimensions: it is a bit shorter and much thicker, feels quite chunky. Lower quality finish, the rubberized back is gone, edges are barely rounded.Still, beats anything else in bright light, so try to get it on sale."
"100","This is a really neat device but is way more complicated than the older versions. It is not totally obvious how it works and the directions are too long and complicated. Also I think that it is ridiculous that the plug is not included you have yo buy it. That is crazy but I do have a spare. Very small and light. May be a little too small although the screen side is the same I think. What is upsetting is every time you have to get a different Kindle the size changes so you cannot use your previous cover!"
"101","Sent item back."
"102","enjoy very much"
"103","Received as a gift. I enjoy the lightness of the kindle and the touch screen. I have only had it a couple of weeks. Very easy to use."
"104","I won a Kindle 6"" at an Awards Dinner, (as a door prize) ..... Lucky Me...  So I opened the sealed box and the unit was already turned on and was in Spanish .... It took me over an hour to get it back to US English,  since I can't read or speak Spanish.  I have an  8"" tablet before this came along, so it's not new to me.  The thing I did like, with this, the battery last a long time, and it's smaller then my tablet and handier to read with, and use. The app used in his Kindle wasn't the best for selections of reading material.... I wanted to get magazines subscriptions just for the kindle.... but of course the app didn't or couldn't go there.  So then, I had to go on line with the computer, to check them out ....  After you set up your account  and register your Kindle with Amazon, You can buy your books and reading material and have it sent directly to your Kindle  (over Wi-Fi to your Kindle email address)  to read and have.  The Kindle will down load it on the unit for you to read... I thought was really pretty cool...A friend of mine said there where places or websites where you could get free books to read, so I am going to look into that soon, after I read the ones I have...Overall:  I think this the right size (6"")  to have.... about the size of a paperback book.  The print can be changed to bigger or smaller so it's not a problem to read.  Easy to carry around and use. I love mine.  It's better then a tablet, because it doesn't light up the screen. The battery last a lot  longer then a tablet.  Thanks,  and Enjoy the Happy Reading..."
"105","I was a legend in Elementary School for the number of books I read and spent hours upon hours of each day reading. I eventually taught myself to speed read in 3rd grade, and from 3rd to 6th grade I read nearly 1/2 of the books in the school library. I was a true book worm and have the plaques and rewards from my 6th grade teacher buried somewhere in a basement. As time went on I grew out of reading. Actually, I grew into other things. I still loved to read however needed to go to school, work 2 jobs, etc etc.Things in the real world have slowly returned to a calmer flow for me and I have really been having the craving to start reading again. I mentioned this and my wonderful, lovely fiancee ordered me a Kindle for Christmas. I have powered through 5 books since then and figured I have used it enough to write a review.My first impression when unboxing and feeling this, my first e-reader, I was shocked at the weight (very light) and the screen (not glossy in the slightest). It came with battery so I pressed the button on the bottom and it powered up. The screen flashes each time it redraws the image displayed, which was weird at first but now I really like it. Gives some feedback as to when you actually press the screen while reading.The screen is nice. Textured smoothly yet it isn't glass smooth like the Fire or Android tablets. Feels like a plasticy paper basically. I like this as well. Helps to remind of the old analog medium. There is some glare (or wash out perhaps?) when a very white light is shone directly on to the screen (IE: LED flashlight/lantern) however you can mitigate this by using a light that is not as bright.No backlight, no problem. I wanted something that was more like a book, not another gosh darned gadget. I have like 4000 different screens I stare at all day long and wanted something that didn't feel digital. I use an old school book lamp which is awesome considering I have had it since the late 90s.The Kindle daily deals are great. Tons of books, changed daily for like 2 bucks. How can you go wrong with that. The lending library is also quite nice, just one more reason to go with the Amazon reader vs the others.The only negative I have about this reader is that my fiancee has requisitioned the use of it as of this past Sunday and told me I can have it back when she is done. I do not know when she will be done with it, so I am ordering another one for me, and one each for my mom, sister, dad, and brother.Overall, I am sold on the e-reader wave. I'll definitely keep buying these things.Also, the Roocase for the Kindle Paperwhite fits this thing wonderfully and is WAY WAY cheaper than the Amazon case."
"106","Have not gotten to use it yet. After seeing 6 chapters on how to use it and couldn't remember all it said, was too much to begin with. Next I hate touch screen items. I tried to find a 5th generation, no luck except used ones (no thanks!) and I really hate it when something works well and someone leaves it for something they think is better. I liked using the buttons and page turners, was easier to go back too. Sometimes u have to touch the page several times to do what u wanted it to. Only got it because I had just gotten many books added and I sure would appreciate gotten to read them on my old kindle. I don't like the offer sections on it and next time won't add but maybe a book at a time if I ever get this one totally set up so I can get into my library to download things. UGGH!"
"107","I wasn't too keen on the idea on getting an e-reader. Call me a romantic but I do love holding a physical books since it comes with perks that e-readers don't (ie: they smell nice, never die out on you, look beautiful on shelves in your room, can bookmark pages with awsome bookmarks,etc). But I've had to change my view on things since I've actually run out of room for all my books. My father had bought me a nook when those first came out but the screen made my eyes sore and it wasn't as enjoyable. And also my brother and me ended up completely ruining it, so it was time for a change. I chose the most basic of the kindles since all I really want to do is read and save space and money. I'm also super bad with technology and don't really need anything fancy. This kindle does the job. I absolutely love it. It's got so many cool features that blow my mind. It's feather light and super thin. So it takes up zero space. I can take it with me everywhere and so it allows me to read whenever I have time. This is honestly a pretty good investment if you are an avid reader with a book wish list that never ends. With the kindle you have a bunch of books at hand at a size smaller than a paperback."
"108","I bought this for my wife who hates reading on the iPad.  She absolutely loves this thing and can hardly put it down.  So far, she's read 4 books on this Kindle and has only used half of the battery life.  I'm even amazed at how much the screen looks just like the page of a book.  I highly recommend this product!!!"
"109","I had the original glare free kindle that gave me the lines of death. I loved it. This one has almost no battery life. I have to go to the cloud and download everything to my kindle. It's thicker, and more cumbersome than the original. I do not like the page turn function in comparison to the original. This one will jump multiple pages every time I set it down even momentarily. I do not consider the more updated version to be equal to the original."
"110","This is a good replacement for my old Kindle (which last about 5 years), BUT it is missing the audio component of the last Kindle.Fewer features for the exact same price.As it happens, I had one Audio book, and so the loss was not that great. But I don't recommend it for people who have many Audiobooks."
"111","I've had a Kindle Keyboard for years and when it quit on me I bought the new Generation 7 touchscreen. I wish you still made the Kindle Keyboard. I am not at all happy with the new one. The new way you have set up to deal with collections sucks. If you are holding the device in your left hand you have to turn the page with your right hand. That's just a couple of the problems with the generation 7. I talked to one of your chat line people and was told that there have been a lot of complaints about the new ""7"" and that the engineers are working on a software update to fix some of the problems. My recommendation to you is to make a ""New Generation"" Kindle Keyboard and make it EXACTLY like the original. You would sell them like hotcakes. I would personally buy a half dozen just so I would never have to go through this again."
"112","Poor backlighting.  Hard to read"
"113","Great for travel, but I still prefer my Kindle Fire HD!!  I purchased this basic Kindle in preparation for a vacation.  I knew I'd be out in the sun a lot and my Kindle Fire screen just isn't conducive to reading in sunlight.  I chose this version of the Kindle because I knew I'd have my Fire HD for reading at night, so didn't want to spend the extra money for the backlight (although I bought a Voyager for my mom and she is really enjoying it).This basic Kindle was just what I needed for the trip.  I spent several hours over a couple of weeks using this without having to re-chare and was able to stay up on my reading.  It's lightweight and fits great in a pocket.  Interestingly, I think the Kindle app features are better than the ones on this basic unit.  Still I would recommend this to anyone who needs something lightweight and convenient for reading out of doors."
"114","Unable to access the on line book store"
"115","I haven't even got this to work yet"
"116","I wish I had never bought this, did not realize that the screen did not light up so night time in bed reading which is what I bought it for. It  is hard to use and understand, I would suggest going ahead and buying a Kindle HD, wish I had."
"117","Terrible hate it.. ."
"118","I previously had a Kindle Keyboard that served me dutifully for five years. That is, until my habit of reading in bed before falling asleep ended up with me planting my knee right in the screen in the middle of the night and cracking it.Looking for a replacement, I didn't really want anything fancy. I just needed a simple e-reader that wouldn't hurt my eyes with the ridiculous amount of time I spend glued to the screen.This kindle isn't all that different from my previous version. I do notice the text seems crisper and consequently slightly easier on my eyes. No, this doesn't have a back light. But I don't really want one. If there's not enough light to read by comfortably, I probably shouldn't be reading in the first place; my eyes get enough abuse as it is.The page turn buttons are gone, but I don't really miss them. It's actually easier to lightly tap the screen as opposed to the buttons on my previous kindle, and makes for a more fluid reading experience.I'm also slightly thankful my old kindle broke and I could justify the purchase of a new one. The touchscreen makes everything so much simpler and faster, especially typing. Thank goodness they don't make the keyboard anymore, haha. Even if I do leave fingerprints everywhere.The internet browser, while hideously slow and really not meant for browsing the internet, is also a bit faster than the previous version. But this is an e-reader. If you're looking for something that does it all, I'd look at the more expensive models. For my purposes, when I just want to look up an article online that I meant to read later, it does just fine.Navigation through the different features is straightforward. Everything's easy to find. Plenty of storage too.One thing I do miss is the ability to listen to audiobooks. It doesn't seem to have any audio output at all.So for an entry level e-reader, this is great, and the price is reasonable."
"119","I have several Kindles. The original one, two Kindle Fires and I bought this one to use as a reader only. It works great and is easy to see outside in the sunlight which is what I was looking for.  I'm very happy with itas I am with my Kindle Fire HDX."
"120","If you're buying this for a kid, don't get the one that includes special offers - the titles that roll through the screen are not age appropriate.  I had to upgrade it to without the special offers.  It may be that this was mentioned in a review before - but I didn't scroll through all the reviews."
"121","The new Kindle e-reader was, and is, exactly what I expected. I purchased it to replace my old e-reader, which no longer worked. Because I got such good service from the old one, I declined the upgraded readers that were offered at discount, and instead ordered the closest thing to my old e-reader. When the new one came, I quickly put it to work, only to discover that it was defective, and worked no better than the old one. I printed a postage-free label online, making a request that it be replaced, not refunded. But when I got the confirmation, it noted that a refund would be given as soon as the returned item had been received. Because I wanted a replacement, not a refund, I called Amazon customer service to straighten it out. The response was swift, and exceptional. The representative not only understood where the mistake had been made, but corrected it, and then ordered a replacement. This was on a Friday. Two days later, on Sunday, the new e-reader was in my mailbox. Quick service is one thing, Sunday delivery quite another. But that's what the representative specified, and that's what I got. The new reader has new features that set it apart from the old. Chief among these is a very easy-to-use touch screen for changing pages, as well as for a number of other functions. The glare-free screen sets it apart from tablets, providing a high quality of readability, even in direct sunlight. This was true of the old one, too, and was a major reason I chose to go with an option close to what I had before. The touch screen eliminates the old page-change buttons, which means fewer moving parts to break, though that never was a problem with my old one. Over all, I have to say I am delighted both with the product, and with the service. The failure of the first reader was unfortunate, but those things happen from time to time with new products. The level of service after the sale was so good that it removed any negative effects the failure of the first product might have left. The replacement e-reader was in my hands well before Amazon received my returned item back, which shows a high level of concern for providing Amazon customers the best possible service. Well done, and I am greatly enjoying the new e-reader."
"122","can I have one for free I'm just a little kid😥😥😥😥😥😞😞😞😞😞😞😖😖😖😖."
"123","Very disappointed that this product does not have a backlit screen."
"124","Hate that i cant read it in dark , only with light on"
"125","I bought two and the next week is 30 dlls less"
"126","I love the paper white e-reader. I got this one for my birthday just a day ago and while the touch-screen is neat I really do not care for it much. I bought the first edition of the kindle with the keyboard and the side buttons to turn pages and it felt as close to reading a book as I could possibly imagine on an electronic device. Your finger could just rest on the button and you 'turn the page', now you have to tap, which that itself isn't a deal breaker, I can handle that, but the device also lost a great feature with the case I had for my old one that snapped right into a cover and had a light that went off the battery of the kindle. Perhaps there is something out there like that, and I hope there is but I was hoping to use the one I had, it was very nice quality. I highly prefer the old version of the kindle, I didn't buy this kindle to play games, or ooh and awe at the 'advanced' technology. All I wanted was a device that would hold my books that I could take anywhere and read whatever I wanted at any time. Instead they try to make this e-reader into some type of tablet. I don't consider it a tablet, I don't want a tablet, if I did the paper white kindle would be the last thing I would choose"
"127","I was using the same Kindle for about 5 years and it was the original gray screen with the letters buttons on the bottom.  Although it still worked, it was cracked and bruised from falling off a car, etc.  I didn't need anything high tech as I have a tablet, but I don't like reading on the tablet, so I bought this new Kindle before vacation.  It has some nice upgrades from my prior kindle, feels sturdier and is easy to hold and read on the BEACH.  Love it!"
"128","I am SO happy with my Kindle!!! I love everything about it - I can read in bed, while traveling (because it just so cutely fits in my coat pocket!). I love the paperwhite edition even more because it's glare-free and that really does the trick.The only thing that I would recommend Amazon to work on is possibly the touchscreen because it is not very touch sensitive. But that's just a minor defect in compared to how amazing the Kindle is overall. I am so glad that I got this because I get to now catch up with my reading even during my super hectic work schedule. Would totally recommend it!"
"129","I had an older Kindle that was wonderful, but it was a little ""clunky"" (in that it was - GASP - about the same ""footprint"" size as my iPad Mini). After I poured coffee on it in a crazy accident at a conference, it was heartbroken. For our anniversary, my wife bought me this new Kindle.I love it! Here's a quick breakdown, staring with the piece I worried most about...I was afraid of the ads being obnoxious and intrusive, but they are almost invisible to me as someone who sees much, much more distracting things on the internet daily. The ads are for books, so it's not like I'm getting things pitched to me that are outside of my realms of interest. For all the scariness of thinking I'm going to get ads consonantly shot at me, it's no problem for me.What's GREAT is everything else. The touch screen is responsive but not ""hair trigger."" The display is as clear as anything. The controls all hide themselves when I don't want them, and the spring into visibility when I need them. It's light and fits easily into a bag or even a pocket on a jacket or cargo pants. So yes, I 100% recommend this if you're looking for a Kindle!"
"130","Terrible"
"131","smaller screen with too wide frame, very bulky and ugly design compared to my older gene kindle. Cant understand."
"132","I regret this purchase assuming it was lighted, it is not, therefore almost useless"
"133","CANNOT CONNECT TO WIFI OR REGISTER....VERY COMPLICATED AND IT IS VERYAGGREVATING"
"134","This is a VERY BEST entry level e-Readers. If you are on the fence for an e-Reader world entry, jump in.I got this eReader for pretty cheap on the Thanks giving sale(including the KindleUnlimited 6 months deal).My kid uses computer for the homework and reading books etc.. but he spends a lot of time on youtube and on other sites.At the same time, he likes reading books(more comic books at this moment though).So, I have decided to give a kindle for this Christmas as a gift to him. I have the gift early in December.Kid is happy and I am happy.I got several hundreds of Kindle books in my amazon account.Overall, the device is real good concept(for the price and for the features). Very easy to use. I am getting this used to my 85 years old Mom, who doesnt no technology except a wrist watch.If you want to give a good and useful gift to your kid, consider this cheapo device.. it would give a great ROI(Return On Investment) in the form of your kid's elevated knowledge without the issue of them in getting onto Youtube/other sites while the reading is the sole purpose of their activity. Amazon, please come up with Kid-centric products. They would fall in with your brand name and mind it, today's kids are tomorrow's amazon customers. :-)"
"135","I bought one of these and now carry it almost everywhere I go. Stuck waiting in line or at the doctor's office or somewhere else unexpectedly? You are prepared!  I am not sure what the max capacity is for one of these, but it's in the thousands of books.  If I were to be marooned on a deserted island, I'd want one of these, loaded with all the reading material that I'd want for the rest of my life (along with a solar charger, of course)."
"136","Got this for my 9 year old son.  He can't even play games on it.  I wanted him to use it for reading but also play educational games to improve his math skills.  This is a big disappoitment.  It is also not user friendly and is hard to navigate.  I wanted a kindle with no ads.  When I requested the ads be removed I was automatically charged for it without authorizing this charge to my credit card."
"137","This is a good deal for the most basic of Kindle devices. You can flip the pages reasonably faster than previous models, although I have seen it lock up and need to be reset after flipping the pages ""blazingly fast"" as was claimed to be able. I was also surprised to see that it had no speakers or headphone jack; I have come to expect those as basic features on a Kindle. Aside from that, it is pretty easy to control, and the User's manual and tutorials do a good job of explaining how to use the basic controls. The screen looks clear and has good contrast, and there are several fonts to choose from. One thing that was annoying is that if you turn off the WiFi to conserve battery power, it complains and asks for you to connect for nearly EVERYTHING besides selecting a different book. I also would like the FreeTime setting to include the ability to store things BESIDES direct Kindle-purchased electronic books, such as pdfs, and other documents."
"138","I already have a larger Kindle, but I wanted a smaller one to carry around for when I have to wait somewhere.  This one fits the bill. I just got a soft sleeve for it, rather than a case, like my other Kindle, because I wanted to keep it light and simple.  It has some extra features, like share, which I do not use.  I read the instructions to figure out how those features work, and how to avoid them, because I don't use them, This is one powerful reading machine in a small form.  I like the lack of a physical keyboard on this model, because I rarely use the keyboard feature, and not having a physical one reduces the size and weight of the unit. In less space than a paperback, I can carry several books depending on what reading mood I'm in.  Well done, Amazon."
"139","This a an excellent little device. I've had it for 2 months and I love it. I have used a Paperwhite and thought it was excellent and would get one of those if I wanted to spend that much, but for the price this represents an excellent value. The design is great and I think it feels higher end. The touch screen is wonderful and the lack of buttons gives it a clean look that I really like. The battery life is likewise amazing and is measured in weeks as opposed to hours or days. I prefer the E-ink display over that of a tablet because it helps with eye fatigue. I always get headaches if I stare at a tablet or computer screen for too long but don't have that issue with the Kindle. In short, if you want something to read books with buy this device, you won't regret it."
"140","Just for the the Kindle Fire"
"141","I bought the kindle during Black Friday for $49.00.  I was charged $79.00 normal price.  I wrote email for correction and recieved email back with reassurance that the cost would be corrected.  It has not been corrected yet.  Other than that the kindle is great, just what I wanted."
"142","I didn't like it! :/"
"143","print too small"
"144","No back light."
"145","I am tickled pink. I love my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I really do. BUT (and these are really big buts for me):1. It is heavy to pack in my purse. Like REALLY EXCRUCIATING after an hour.2. It is a battery hog. And that is an  understatement.3. Even with the amoled screen, the glare is piercing to my eyes in bright sunlight.This little reader solves every single complaint I have with my fire. I still will use the fire... At home. And at night the fire beats this.The screen, even under direct light, has no glare. It is like looking at the page of a paper book. Battery life? Wow! And is it lightweight? Uh, YEAH! Furthermore, the touch screen means you can easily read with one hand AND turn the page. What more could I ask for. A light. Yeah, but I have my fire for that.The only drawback I can honestly see is that when delivered, mine had a small smudge. This drives me nuts, so they are replacing it... I think the screen might be kind of fragile, so I am buying a case to protect it."
"146","I bought the kindle for my son who has dyslexia.  Being able to adjust the font is very helpful for him.  I sent a request to Amazon to consider adding the dyslexia font to the Kindle and you DID!!  This font is really miraculous for people with dyslexia.  My son's reading speed is about twice as fast with this font and his love of reading is multiplied by about a million.  Also, we have 3 more of these kindles for the other readers in the family and we all love it.  I didn't think i could make the transition from paper but I might like the kindle even better.  It's so light in my hand and the appearance of the screen is very similar to paper.  Personally, I wouldn't want one that is back lit since it would be like reading on a tablet, which I think is wearing on the eyes after a while and is stimulating rather than relaxing when reading before bed.  THANK YOU AGAIN AMAZON!"
"147","The ads are annoying and the only way to retrieve the book one is reading is to turn the machine off and then one is able to swipe the ad away.  If this Kindle is for a senior citizen, do not purchase as it is confusing on how to get rid of the ad.  Instead of just leaving the book and able to turn it back on later to where you left off, there are annoying ads to bet rid of.  My mother is 80 years old and cannot figure out how to use the Kindle without my assistance.  In hindsight I should have purchased another Kindle type without ads."
"148","I loathe this device. When you don't intend to touch it, it does something. When you do intend to touch it to turn the page or go back or get a definition, it does nothing. Since Amazon is now only offering touch devices, I believe I am done with Kindle readers. As the multiple Kindles that I have die off, I will use my PC and/or my iPad to read Kindle books - that is assuming that Amazon works out the bugs in those apps. Failing that, I guess I will go back to physical books. It was nice while it lasted but Amazon has gotten too far off track for me."
"149","I am not a ""touch screen"" person and find it hard to manipulate.  I have yet to get my settings the way I prefer them.  I would be much happier with the original ""vanilla"" verson of Kindle."
"150","I can't figure out how to order books."
"151","Did not meet my expectations."
"152","I don't like the touch screen, I miss real buttons, I miss the keyboard,  I have the second generation kindle,  I say go back to the original drawing board, get back to basics, and make it the way it was.  At least you stuck to the real e-ink on this one,."
"153","If I had read/researched more carefully I wouldn't have bought this and just bought another Kobo. No epub! That means to read any of my current 1600+ library I have to convert them. Also no PDF. The ad at the bottom of the fist screen is very annoying and the ad on sleep screen is annoying. Other than that it is ok for what it does. Clear text, lightweight, good size.  It has a nice feature where you or anyone you pre-allow can email you documents to read. But not PDF... I'm just rating it down 1 for the ads and not using all common formats."
"154","The screen is not working. How do I get a replacement?  Thanks"
"155","Not happy did not have a brightness control sent it back"
"156","Unable to send highlighted wording to social media"
"157","It has no sound!!!! Going to return..."
"158","This is without doubt the worst kindle I have ever used.It has touch screen controls that are frustrating to use.  Constantly distracting the reader with unintentional changes caused by the slightest whisper of contact.  Even contact with the frame alone will sometimes result in unintentional activation of some of the features (e.g. change font size) on this reader.  Then often requires repeated contacts to activate a wanted feature (e.g. change font size).Perhaps someway to program and lock in some features like font size would make this more user friendly.  Why does Amazon would sell such a product?Perhaps they need some of us to go back to paper - I know I look for real books much more frequently now!Steve"
"159","as good as the original kindle, maybe better.  I had my other kindle for 8 years, and i dropped it in the bathtub.........fried it!!  i love the fact that there is NO glare, so i can use it out in bright sunlight.  don't spend the extra 20 bucks for the 'no advertising', because it's no big deal.....it's just advertising for other books available (that might be useful)........small, great clarity, and just a great little device!"
"160","I like the paperwhite screen, it is easier on the eyes then reading on a tablet or computer.  It is lightweight and holds a charge forever.  However it is only really good for text, for music books or text books any graphics are virtually illegible."
"161","Another piece of Amazon crap.  I have never owned a Kindle that lasted more than 6 months, heck not even 4 months.  My latest Kindle up and decided today not to connect to WIFI.  I have a dozen things connected to my wifi but the darn Kindle decides, nah I don't want to connect to wifi any more.In the trash it goes.  Why do I try to use those stupid things.  The Android app works great and I guess I'll have to stick to that.  My third Kindle in the trash, same with the Fire TV, tried that too, was unreliable 1/2 the apps didn't work but of course why would Amazon want HULU to work, think about it...."
"162","Was looking for something to play games on. We returned this item."
"163","My 5-button Kindle died, so this replaced it.  I like the touch screen…easier to enter text for searches, etc.  It is a bit thicker than my old 5-button kindle, though, and the edges aren't quite as rounded.  Good replacement, though."
"164","I have the original Kindle Keyboard and love reading on it but dislike how cumbersome it is to navigate or type using the keyboard and buttons. The screen is also so yellow that it can be hard to read (I'm 50, if that helps). When I saw the ad for this new Kindle (7th gen) it said the font was darker and the pictures of it show a whiter screen. I was thrilled that it had a touchscreen as well.Well the screen is actually MORE yellow than my original Kindle Keyboard! Also, the font used on the Home page list of books is so fine and pale that it's really hard to read (and you can't change it). The Keyboard's Home list is dark and clear. Highlighted sentences are REALLY hard to read, unlike the Keyboard. I was so disappointed to see all this and am puzzled as to why Amazon would take a giant step backwards in the non-touchscreen aspects.I also don't like how slippery it is to hold. I like to use my Kindle ""naked"" since it keeps it lightweight. The original Keyboard had a slightly rubberized back. (It also looked a lot nicer, but that alone wouldn't turn me off the new one.)I only paid $50 for mine on a Black Friday special, but it's going back. It's not worth buying a new Kindle just to have a touchscreen. It sounds like the PaperWhite is probably a better match for me if it truly has a whiter screen, but $119 is way too much for me."
"165","I've had a kindle since they came out, and have never been disappointed.  The main and most important feature for me is to read in broad daylight, outside on the patio, at the beach, in my chair or anywhere.  Beside all of the other features of Amazon, this is what sold me.  When my kindle-keyboard screen cracked, I went without for a while, but decided I missed having my library with me and looked at all the (numerous) versions of kindle out now.  Not like when I first bought one.  But it all came back to the ease of reading and the portable size.  The one feature I always thought the kindle should have, touch screen to turn pages, this one had, so I tried it.  I love it.  Same  clear, good reading and the added feature of touch-screen. Sometimes I miss the free 3g for browsing and downloading books anywhere, but nowdays I'm usually fairly close to a free wi-fi connection so it's not a big deal.  It also seems that they eliminated the earphone jack and the text-to-speach feature on this kindle, but I rarely used those features anyway.  I bought a kindle to read and it works for me.  I would order this version of kindle again"
"166","I was disappointed that it doesn't have a light up screen for reading in darkened room. Other than that it's good."
"167","Even with the most basic model, Amazon still makes a worthwhile e-reader.  Granted, I bought Kindle Fire HD 6 to be shared with the family, its been passed around so much that by the time it get passed along to me, I don't have much time to read.  I knew it was going to happen eventually, so when it sooner than I expected I settled on a refurbished Kindle Touch.  In this case, ""settling"" turnout to be one the best decisions I made in while.The refurbished Kindle Touch is almost indistinguishable from its ""new"" predecessors except sometime during lifetime it was returned to Amazon for some reason.  The device itself the most basic of e-reader offered by Amazon primarily to get you to buy e-books from their online store but can also be used read e-books borrowed from public libraries and carry around compatible personal documents, pending you don't mind the monochrome presentation.  Resembling a small tablet computer (in alot of respects, it is), an e-reader distinguishes itself from tablets with a monochrome ""electronic ink"" screen that does not refresh itself like other LCD screens and has a lower power consumption rate that can make the battery last for days, weeks between recharges.  This is a dedicated e-reader - there are no apps that can be installed and no speaker or headphone jack to listen to *.mp3s or audiobooks - perhaps more importantly, this model is not a Paperwhite and you must have your external light source to read in low-light situations.As good as it is, there is one major fault that I discovered the hard way.  While Amazon elaborates in alot of official documentation about personal documents and cloud storage, a rather perverse semantics come into play - access to the cloud library is NOT the same as Amazon's Cloud drive.  In other words, if you have personal files stored on Amazon's cloud drive they will not be accessible from this version of the Kindle.  In order to read your personal documents from the Kindle, you must either send them via e-mail or copy them via USB.  As a corollary, by plugging in this Kindle to your computer, it's identified as mass storage device so managing it is not much different from a USB flash drive.If you can keep the above in mind, I think you can really make for you.  I bought the refurbished Kindle primarily to save every cent I could and what I get out of it more than makes up for its limits - you can buy inexpensive generic clip-on spotlight for low-light reading and if all you do to read, the Kindle is more than suited to the task with the durability and ease of use you can only get at these prices.  In addition to buying Kindle, I would recommend buying folio-type cover and screen protector to further increase the longevity of your Kindle."
"168","i can't get to the toolbar to turn the light on. i have followed the directions and even reset the kindle. still no light."
"169","I've only had this for 2 weeks, but absolutely love it so far, and this is coming from a dedicated hardcopy book reader! Maybe its because I'm reading in a digital format as opposed to a physical one, but having the kindle makes me excited to rrad again. It's super light weight, and I really like the handy dictionary tools among its other features. Super happy that I bought this. I only wish I bought it sooner ^ - ^"
"170","it is stuck in spanish and I can't get it to English. It came this way and I cannot resolve it. waste of money."
"171","I really miss the kindle that was not touch screen.  This is fine, and I can read clearly, but occasionally I touch the screen or it gets heated up and clicks when I dont want it to.  It works fine, but its mildly annoying."
"172","I bought 3 of this. I like it better than the new ones. The new one has glare, direct light to my eyes, make my eyes tired easily.  Kindle, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen just like reading books without the weight of a think book. We all love it!"
"173","If you are replacing an older Kindle and use audiobooks, bewre.  This piece of crap won't support them."
"174","You get what u pay for, which isn't much.  Tried to get my mom into the technology age, but she (and I) hated it."
"175","Got a Kindle on the Amazon Prime sale for my book worm wife. My oldest (9yr old dayghter) whom we have tried to get to read all summer stole the Kindle and has been reading non-stop.  She gets up to to read now.  She even uses the built in dictionary to try and learn unknown words and highlights them for us to teach her the word later if she can't figure it out."
"176","The Kindle would not let me download any word games to play.  I was extremely unsatisfied with it."
"177","I love this device! When they first came out I was against them. Only recently after watching some videos by others did my interest get peeked enough to write out a pro/con list. The E-Reader won by a lot. Yes, the regular book is very special and unique, a classic always, but the e-reader makes it more efficient and user friendly. The device is very light weight and easy to hold compared to regular paperbacks and hard covers. Two of the best qualities for this device is 1) it can hold several thousands books. No more bulk carrying or having a hard time deciding which book to bring with you out of the house, you bring them all! 2) the built-in dictionary and online wifi ability to search further on words, terms and phrases! Pricing for e-books tied for pro and con as some books can be very cheap while others either the same or more expensive than the actual book. But the other pros outweighs this cons. In the end you will save money throughout buying your collection. You will also never have to buy an addition copy due to losing the book, giving it away or damage that can be very easy. One book I had bought 4 times due to poor binding style. But now I will never have to buy again! I'd highly recommend the E-Reader to anyone. It doesn't mean you will never buy or read a regular book. I still own books, but mostly all my fiction and smaller novels are on e-book format while picture books and larger history, study or research books I buy in regular format."
"178","do not like checking on returning it. no light and you dont have audio  very dissappointed on this product .pages not easy to turn. very hard to read ."
"179","Reading on a Kindle has become a tolerable experience. Pages flip with relative ease and there is a minimum of page refresh distraction. Unfortunately, absolutely everything else about the experience ranges from annoying to impossible.On the hardware side, the capacitative touch screen is insensitive and imprecise. Attempting to highlight text, for example, is a fiddly affair, with the position of the cursors, especially the endpoint, often seemingly placed at random. Adjusting the cursors to the desired start and end points can be difficult, even impossible. Every action seems to move at a snail's pace; my original iPad, almost five years old now, is a speed demon in comparison. WiFi connectivity is slow, cantankerous, and sometimes unreliable, regardless of the actual signal strength.The software is a mess, full stop. It is slow, ugly, and violates just about every usability protocol. For example, important functions are often nested several layers deep. Because the menus are context sensitive, a desired function may require several extra steps to access as it is only available in certain contexts; the exact opposite effect context aware menus are supposed to have. The software keyboard is particularly slow and unresponsive, and its spelling suggestions can be bizarre. Forget a passcode or parental control password? You have to reset the entire device, which includes reregistering the device (including reentering your Amazon password); going through the ""How To"" guide, a step which cannot be skipped; and re-adding all of your content manually.Amazon FreeTime Unlimited, which I subscribed to for my daughter, is, perhaps, even less well laid out than the full Kindle experience. Further, the books included are rarely of any quality, skewing towards product tie ins and low-rent graphic novels. Adding books from my full adult library, which should be easy, requires entering the parental password twice, for no reason whatsoever; after all, the user has already entered the password to edit a FreeTime profile; why should it be entered again to add books?In conclusion, I don't expect this review to change anyone's mind, least of all Amazon's. After all, Kindles keep selling, and Amazon's selection of available content is nigh unbeatable. If all you want to do is carry around a library and read, it's tolerable. For any other purpose, the headaches and frustration mount. I couldn't, for example, imagine using a Kindle for school, where functions like highlighting and note taking become more important. Perhaps by the 15th or 20th generation, the usability and responsiveness will rival a first gen iPad or, for that matter, my long departed Handspring PDA. One can always hope."
"180","Love it, love it, love it!!!!  I'm enjoying my new Kindle very much.  I enjoyed the older one with the keyboard as well but unfortunately, it was stolen out of my bag at the West Palm airport.  Purchased this one and it's great!!!  Getting used the much smaller size of the overall Kindle but it's much easier to carry in my pocketbook and I love the touch screen feature as well.  Great job Amazon (as usual)!!!"
"181","Would like this better if I hadn't owned the previous version. the touch screen doesn't add much for the functionality, and I liked the side buttons better. thinker and heavier, but not bad. not having controls on the bottom makes the screen look smaller and off center, but that is just esthetic."
"182","so my kindle 3 finally crapped out on me. It was a sad day since that thing had been handed down to me and gone through a lot. It survived drops, spills, a busted (and twice repaired) USB port, lost buttons, and exposure to the elements. In other words, it was a true workhorse. Unfortunately, one last drop was its untimely end and the screen finally succumbed to the abuse it had handled for 2 and half years.I was a little weary about purchasing a new ebook reader, as I prefer real, concrete pages over electronic data, but I had a lot of good memories with the past kindle and the thing served me well. When Amazon ran a Valentine's Day special for the newest generation at a measly 60 bucks, I couldn't resist.It's true I've had the device for less than 2 weeks, and it's true maybe its quirks will come out later, but I don't see that happening. The kindle 7 is a piece of technological art. It's not pretty in that sense, but it's a work of art in what it does and offers.I mean, it'll hold thousands of books! And the battery will last hundreds of hours! I've used my continuously for a week and the battery is still more than half full. Not only that, but it's touch screen, has wifi and is just the right size. And speaking of right size, the options for text size range from the very minuscule (my favorite) to the ginormous (perfect for when I try to read at the gym). It's super light, intuitive, and insanely easy to use.Yeah, it doesn't have a light. And yeah, it's boring black and white, but you know what? Who cares? It's for books! Books don't have lights. And unless it's a children's book, a coffee table time, or a collectors edition, the novel you just paid 10 dollars for is heavier, takes up more space, and most assuredly isn't in color.Seriously though, this kindle is awesome and I haven't been happier with a technological device since my iPhone 6. Sure, I predict I'll be getting an iPad in the future, but until then, the kindle 7 is my e-reader of choice and worth every penny!"
"183","It was a birthday gift. I really wanted one with a built-in light. Not happy with it, but my husband didn't know about a light. So now I'm stuck with it through no fault of Kindle."
"184","I purchased this model for my mom, to see if she would like it.  (Not big on new technology as a rule.)  She loves it!  Mom enjoys reading on it, even uses it every morning as part of her devotions with her Bible loaded on the Kindle.  It is easy to use, compact, the text display size can be adjusted for her comfort, and I don't think she has missed a day of using it since she received it on Christmas."
"185","My kindle died at one year, 3 months  it was replaced.  One year and three months later the same exact thing happened to the new kindle.  Both times, it refused to charge .  The charging port is poorly installed with an inferior design.  The only thing amazon had to offer me was a reconditioned one for 110 dollars or 20 off a 179.00 model.  So figure that you will get two years usage out of a Kindle it is a disposable product.  They won't tell you that but if you google the kindle you will find that everyone knows it.  I am pissed that you can sell something that has failed time and time again and not  admit in your advertising that the design is limited.  Why would you not want to fix an engineering problem so your product lasts longer...oh I know why.. you can sell more that way.  I refuse to buy a new kindle.  I bought a galaxy tablet.  Shame on you Amazon... made in America used to mean something..  no wonder now why our economy sucks."
"186","Amazon does it again with another great Kindle. The touchscreen is easy to navigate, although I do miss the buttons from the previous generation a little. Great display and stays charged for such a long time!"
"187","I have not received the goods, but do not know why the show had been delivered. Now I don't know what to do, please contact our customer service personnel."
"188","Amazing! [...] - I got free Clash of Clans gems here! Get yous too in less than two minutes!! Everybody is already using free gems from here.(HCE478iqsU)p"
"189","I LOVE my kindle. This is my first kindle ever, and I love it. The only thing I really dislike about it is that the screen is incredibly sensitive and lint always gets caught on the insides of the screen. Had to give it 4 stars because of those two reasons, but other than that I love it. It's so much lighter than having my regular books, especially when it comes to traveling."
"190","I loved my Kindle Keyboard, but it just died (I have a feeling my two-year-old stepped on the screen), so I needed a replacement.This is the option I went with, and I am very happy with my choice.Before purchasing, I was worried about the touch-screen – I thought the screen would get dirty from constant touching, and that it wouldn't be very responsive compare to hard buttons. Neither of these concerns is an issue: the screen stays clean and the touch-screen is VERY responsive – almost shockingly so. I would venture to say it's the most responsive touch-screen I've ever used, on any kind of device. The page-turn time is also shorter, so this device feels fast.I will say that it feels quite a bit cheaper than my previous Kindle. There is no longer the non-slip material on the back (which I miss), now it's all the same hard plastic. It also feels sort of ""hollow"" and flimsy compared to the solid heft of the Kindle Keyboard. It's also kind of boxy. Still feels nice in the hand overall, though, and it's a pleasure to use.Finally (and this is purely based on my memory), I think that the contrast on this might be slightly less than my previous Kindle. But it's close, and certainly isn't an issue.The ""special offers"" are not intrusive at all. Some of them actually are useful (e.g., books I may be interested in, useful accessories, etc.) I wouldn't shy away from saving some money and ""putting up"" with the offers.Overall, a very nice Kindle for the money. Recommended."
"191","needs backlight"
"192","This is junk."
"193","Crap device"
"194","I finally needed to replace by 6 year old keyboard kindle, and bought this. I am honestly disappointed in all the ADDS!!!! So many adds, recommendations, etc.. taking up the whole screen. Though the touch screen function is nice, it doesn't feel worth all of the advertising pop ups."
"195","I've been on something of a minimalist kick as of late, envious of those adhering to the 100 (or sometimes even less) things challenge to eliminate clutter, live more simply, avoid retail therapy, etc. The Kindle has been more or less on my radar since it came out, but around christmas time last year, a special promo sale on this, the most basic model, finally caused me to pull the trigger. For the cost of a few books (or to be fair, the cost of the last technical book I bought), I thought this was a very smart buy. Not only did I have a number of PDFs and Kindle books I had already bought, but I wouldn't worry about my ""things count"" or clutter level when continuing to buy books.This reader is the most stripped down of the Kindle line, possibly ever, though it does include a touch screen. The form factor is good, it's the weight and dimensions it should be. The display is good. I'm surprised when I'm asked about eInk type displays. Many more people than I would have guessed do not realize the difference between a screen like this and phone/ipad display. Amazon probably doesn't help this matter by selling both backlit and Android-derived tablets also under the Kindle name. The screen is worlds easier on your eyes than the laptop/tablet/TV LCDs we're all so used to. The text can obviously be adjusted to where you like it. This must be a godsend for people who would ordinarily seek out large-print books, which are special orders and obviously not available for every book.The touch screen functionality, however, is not that great. It's just not what we're used to, which to be fair, is on much more expensive devices like the iPad. While it works, especially for opening books, changing pages, and such, it's tedious if you try and use it on the browser, for example, the way you might on a tablet. Although it's not perfect, I'd probably rather have this over a physical keyboard a la the early generation Kindles.On that note, the Kindle includes an experimental browser (I think it's quite literally called the Experimental Browser even- which is a good way to manage the expectations of anyone using this feature!). It's an utterly charming way to surf the Internet. If you ever wondered what the web would be like on a compact, b/w Mac from 1991, here it is. For me, it tends to crash a lot as well, but when it's working properly it's pretty cool. Seems to have a good amount of trouble connecting to public wi-fi that sends you to a portal page. I haven't looked into Kindle-friendly web sites yet, but I remain intrigued by this feature and glad it's there.The battery life is excellent. One of the best features for this in a world where noone's anything is ever charged. The ""features"" this particular model lacks only serve to prolong battery life. I also appreciate that when connected to a computer, this shows up as a drive, and files can be dragged and dropped (store purchases just show up when the Kindle is on wi-fi and purchases are directed to send them there). A wise choice considering how frustrating Apple is with regards to the way iTunes is required to manage those devices.All in all, I am really happy with this product."
"196","Amazing! I love the kindle the new design is wonderful for children too. It's about the width of a standard pencil, and weighing only 6 ounces, there are no bulky books to carry! As with all Kindles the Kindle 6 is a dedicated e-reader, meaning children will stay focused without the distractions of a computer or internet. Which I think is a great Idea, also most notably, you can comfortably read the Paperwhite in bright sunlight without any glare, which is one of the biggest advantages to using an eBook reader compared to a iPhone. also I love that the amazon book store has there books so cheap like .99-5.99 for some books!, The screen is front lit ,LED lights along the edge of the display shine down onto the digital page not from the back of the screen like many other eBook readers and tablets do. So over all I don't see any cons in this E reader and its budget friendly as well! I recommend this to anyone that likes to read many books but at a great price as well! I recommend this for ages five and up!"
"197","There's two ways to review this:  as a stand-alone product or comparison to a Nook e-ink reader of the same size.  I'll mainly focus on the comparison:Good:  Syncs easily with Amazon and Prime features open up free options.  The background on the Kindle is slightly lighter than on the nook.  That offers more contrast but really is a matter of personal taste whether you would consider that a good or bad thing.  I've read for hours straight on both and suffer no more or less eye strain on either.  Charging the Kindle is easier and more universal than the Nook.  The Nook requires nook specific charger and even micro usb cable to work properly while the Kindle seems to work regardless of cable or plugging into a number charger types.Less than Optimal:  I have yet to find a battery percentage on the Kindle.  The Nook has the icon and an easy way to get to a screen that shows what percent of the battery life remains.  That little icon on the Kindle doesn't offer enough information to know whether you have 30 or 5% left.Page numbers.  The Nook automatically calculates how many pages your book has based on the font and size you choose and then gives you a display saying page x of y.  The Kindle gives you different options, including page #, but it doesn't give you page x of y.  It'll give you page number and x% complete.  Which again, lacks specificity like the battery meter.  The Nook has a touchscreen like the kindle for page turning but also has 4 buttons that can be configured for one handed reading and page turning without have to touch the screen.  I typically read with the item resting in my left hand, which means to turn the page on the kindle I have to bring my right hand up and either swipe or touch the right side of the screen.  With the Nook, I can set the lower left button, which i can reach with my left thumb, to turn the page forward so my right hand can hold my drink or shoveling chex mix in without worrying about dripping, spilling, or getting the e-reader grubby.Similar:  Screen size, case size, although the Kindle ""feels"" lighter.  I don't have a scale for these light weights and i haven't checked the specs on both to compare but it does feel lighter.  The Nook on the other hand has more of a rounded back which gives it a softer feel.  Again, that is personal preference on whether you would consider that a good or bad option.  In either case, I don't have big hands and they both rest comfortably for long periods of time.The Kindle is a solid performer but if comparing to the Nook, I'd give the Nook a slight edge in the area of form and function.  When it comes to searching for books, the next in the series, and some other software type areas the Kindle wins especially with Prime."
"198","would be better with back light."
"199","I find it very disruptive while you are trying to read by font changing sizes or something popping up with movement of the Kindle. I read for relaxation not for more stress. Please return to the buttons. I also liked the way you could archive your book once you read it so only the books you haven't read we're on the Kindle. I have read the instructions for use and still haven't figured it out for this model. I would not recommend it."
"200","I swore I would never buy a kindle because I love my paper books but after finding a book I really wanted to read that was only available on e-reader and then I got a free trial of kindle unlimited and saw that they had Princess Bride and stuff like that I broke and bought one! I LOVE that it has an off-white color to it. I get migraines from white (especially computers) and so this makes it easier to read without getting a horrible migraine! It works really well and I all together adore it!"
"201","I just got this in the last week, but so far I'm in love with it.  It's easy to read on, the letters are very crisp and its easy to turn pages. I don't have very large hands and it's the perfect size, kind of like an actual book, but thinner! I like that I can buy books straight from the kindle, and don't have to go and plug it into my laptop to sync.  It fits easily in my purse or bag and seems pretty sturdy.  I waited a really long time to get an e-reader because I just really like reading on paper better. I'm glad I waited because this version is really great. I still kind of get the feeling of reading on paper, and my eyes don't get tired like they do on my iPad or others. So far, it's been a great addition to my bookshelf!"
"202","I purchased this Kindle to read books. It does just that. It doesn't have any other features.I own a tablet that I use for the other functions. I wanted an inexpensive and convenient way to carry a large number of books with me. This fits the bill!  It is light weight and a perfect size that I can slip into my purse and take it everywhere.  Also if I accidentally leave it somewhere I'm not out 100's of dollars like my tablet.This Kindle is perfect for reading outside when we are camping. I struggle to see my tablet in the sun.  This Kindle is not lit so you can't read in the dark. I don't tend to read in the dark, so it is not an issue for me.It all depends on what you want to use it for. If you want a way to just purchase and read books, this is the Kindle for you. If you want to surf the internet or read email, look at another model.The last Kindle I owned was one of the originals and didn't have a touch screen. You had to change pages by pressing a button. This is leaps and bounds beyond!Love it!"
"203","This is my very first kindle. I was really not sure what to expect when I ordered it. I had always just read books but I saw how much cheaper e books are and thought I would try it out. I did a lot of research trying to find the Kindle that would be best for me, I don't need a back light or buttons that turn the page when pressed. So this very basic model was perfect for me. I am very happy with my purchase and at only $79 this is a steal."
"204","too small------- returning for kindle fire"
"205","Get a paperwhite. This thing is rubbish."
"206","Can this be read in the bright sunlight?"
"207","I was addicted to Thread Words and a few other word games on my old Kindle. When it broke, I thought this model would be a comparable replacement. This Kindle does not support any games. I am so disappointed. Also, it is a different size so I guess I just have to throw away my nice leather cover with light. I miss my old Kindle."
"208","This is a great basic reader. It has no bells and whistles, it is not in color, and you can't play games or watch movies on it, which is just what I want. It is small and compact and I can take it with me almost anywhere. It is easy to set-up and easy to use. When you purchase Kindle books you can have them delivered right to it, which is great. It's no glare screen is so nice compared to my iPad which I had been using to read. I can read it at the beach, on the bus, in front of a bright window, really anywhere. There is no back-light, but a simple reading light can help with that. I highly recommend this reader to anyone who wants a good, basic reader."
"209","I LOVE this kindle! It's slim, compact and so light to hold. It's great to be able to read clearly when I'm outside with no glare reflecting off the screen.I previously read books using the kindle app on my iPad mini but now I realize how bulky that was and, on sunny days, I had to tip the iPad this way & that to try and find a way to read with no glare, that doesn't happen with my kindle.This kindle does not have a backlight but I'm fine with that as I don't feel the need to read in the dark."
"210","Very easy and nice to read, lightweight and size is great, the one with light is really better, but plastic cover is too soft and breakable so you must take extremely care or buy an extra cover for make it durable."
"211","Why did I pay for something only to be bombarded by ads??? Really???"
"212","I'm used to a pad thought I would try this.  and hated it."
"213","Ordered it by mistake so i returned itSorry"
"214","Not backlit, so how am I supposed to read in bed?"
"215","It's for Christmas so I really haven't used it"
"216","Unfortunately my last kindle got left at a hotel that refused to send it to me (that bad review went on another site) so when I went to get a new one, I had to go with the new touchscreen version.  Not that it's bad...it's just different. I like my kindle as simple as can be-I use it to read books and nothing more, and had no issue using the side buttons.  The finger swipe took a bit to get used to.  The new kindle is also bulkier...due to the touch technology, I'm sure, but I liked the light, sleek design of the last version.Lastly...they say pages turn much faster...but if anything, the page turn feels a bit slower to me, and after using the device only a couple times, it's already been freezing on me a bit.  At the base of it, the kindle is still the best ereader out there (in my opinion) and when this one eventually goes, either through technical failure or loss, I'll surely get another...but I've gotta say, I do miss the last generation a bit."
"217","I am completely in love with this product of kindle. It's not bulky and not even of odd size. You can hold it for hours and feel just like you are reading the book. The text appears just the way you see them in a book. It's glare free and I was amazed to see it and read in it because I hate reading the ebooks and was against buying it but my husband insisted that we should atleast try it to see and decide and now we literally fight to get our turn to read on this amazing device. One more thing the charge of this kindly device is for days it's been 4 days and u have lot charged it and I read for almost 2 hrs daily.I strongly recommend it"
"218","CAME FAST, EASY TO USE, just bought a KINDLE from Amazon, LOVE IT, SO COOL, downloading free books and books for under 2.00, awesome to have a library going on in my pocket. (almost said pants smile emoticon ) i recommend you all get one it is awesome."
"219","I have been a kindle owner for the past 5 years until this past June when my keyboard kindle died and since the price was good and in desperate need to get one again, I bought the new kindle and I'm loving it so far! It was fairly easy to work but it is kinda weird not having the keyboard around anymore but it does make it much easier to work knowing there is only one button on the device now instead of 30 or more. Granted I only had it for a day but I'm seeing a much improvement in my reading over reading on a phone. Hopefully this will last me for the next 4 or 5 years and when this one dies, I will be back to buy a new kindle whatever that may be!"
"220","I have an original Kindle Fire.  I am still in love with it.  I use it all the time.  I bought this less expensive paperwhite for travel, and especially beach reading.  I am generally pleased.  I do find the screen to be too cramped to be comfortable.  I do wish it had a little better contrast for indoors, and that it had a night light feature for reading in bed.  I really only want to travel with one device, and it needs to be inexpensive enough to be replaced, if necessary; but, it needs to be versatile enough to read day or night."
"221","This product was advertised as $ 49.99 Order # 115-3134875-6279403. But this on my credit card R $ 99.99"
"222","Worked one day, then light went out. No reason. Look elsewhere, pay more, but you time's worth more."
"223","THE KINDLE IS WORTHLESS TO ME BECAUSE I CANNOT DOWNLOAD BOOKS. AND AMAZON HELP CAN'T HELP."
"224","I expected that this would be higher quality. Can barely read the screen. It needs to be brighter with better resolution."
"225","This review is targeted to those completely new to kindles since I noticed most of the other reviews seem to assume familiarity with other kindle products.My background: For the past five years I've been doing most of my book reading on either my iPad or iPhone (yes, I find reading books on my phone quite comfortable actually!). The problem with both of them is the LIGHT, they're just too shiny to read in bed while I'm trying to fall asleep(even with the ""invert colors"" option turned on). It was either get more and more paper books (inconvenient), or try something else. Hence, the basic kindle.I chose the basic kindle because despite reading a ton of reviews, I couldn't figure out what was so great about the kindle Paperwhite(119$) or kindle Voyager(199$) compared with $79 for the basic kindle. They have more bells and whistles but the core functionality appears to be the same. So far I think I made the right choice.CONS(1) It feels very cheap and plastic compared to an iPad. But this is not surprising considering the price difference.(2) The screen responds very slowly. Scrolling through a large amount of text is PAINFUL. But in reality this is not a problem since page turning inside a book is really the only thing you need to do most of the time and that part is fine.(3) If you don't pay the extra 20.00 you get ads at the bottom of the home screen. But these ads are not too obtrusive. I don't plan on paying.PROS(1) The screen is PERFECT for reading in bed because it emits NO LIGHT. It's the same as reading a paperback. Of course you would need to have a lamp on, but I think that's good as I don't think reading in the dark with just the light from an electronic device would be good for your eyes.(2) You can browse and buy books directly from the kindle. Warning: Your account is charged and books download INSTANTLY when you click ""Buy"", there is no confirmation screen. This is convenient if you know exactly what you want, but it's easier to do browsing on a regular computer due to the aforementioned painfully slow screen.(3) Easy to use, stays charged for a long time(I haven't tested their claim of ""weeks"", but based on the low power usage I could believe it), automatically syncs across all your kindle device, all the good things you would expect.Overall, I think this is good value if you(1) Read books in the sun where screen glare could be a problem.(2) Want to read in bed and don't like the bright light from from most electronic displays.I can't say if the other more advanced kindle versions are worth the extra money, but so far I'm liking this one."
"226","I was very disappointed. I spent a lot of money for a black and white unlit kindle. my son got one for almost half that was lit, in color and many more features. this was truly a waste of money."
"227","It is totally different from my Sony. The icons are all there, but hidden.  I am having a very hardtime adjusting to it.  As a matter of fact have thought about returning it."
"228","I already had the  several Nooks but after getting Amazon Prime I decided to get an Kindle for the free monthly book loan program.  The Kindle special offers are shown on the locked page. The ads do not interfere with reading a book. With WiFi the books are easily downloaded. There is no glare in the sunlight.  Tap the edge to turn the paper, nothing easier.  The added dictionary is great. What I like most is the ability to get information on the characters with just a touch.Update: 03/08/2015I had stopped using the actual Kindle for about a month. Through  Prime  Free Book  download , the book is only available on the actual Kindle not through the Kindle app on my phone.  Fine, but I carry my phone more than my Kindle.When I wanted to go read the book I had down loaded. I realized I forget the correct name. It took a few minutes to find the book.It would be nice if the Kindle had a recent read tab.  If it's been a while, the recent read tab will still have the book near the top. At the present time the only categories are by recent download , Author or collection.It is nice that PDF formatted books are able to be downloaded.  So many Authors allow you to get their book free online. I download on my phone and send to my Kindle. It appears as a Doc on the Kindle and on the phone app.Other than the problem reading Free  Prime book, I am extremely pleased with the Kindle. So much so that I have ordered the Kindle Fire for my Daughter who  preference had been her Nook HD."
"229","How could you not have a brightening/light feature?  We assumed this was standard and ordered this for our son. Please add that to product specs!"
"230","I bought this when it was on sale for $20 off the usual price (lowering it to a price I was willing to pay in order to experiment with an e-reader).  I initially had the free offers version, but found that often the Kindle had trouble waking up from the ads when I swiped to start reading.  That was very annoying, so once I decided that I liked the Kindle and wanted to keep it I was really happy to find that I could just pay the $20 difference to have the Kindle updated to remove the ads.  Haven't regretted getting rid of them since. I wish there was a light built in, and if in the future I decide I need a new e-reader I'll probably want to get one with that feature, but for now I'm happy with my experiment.  I still really enjoy reading actual paper books, but I also like reading them on the Kindle.  It always remembers exactly where I am in the book, even if I have to check out an e-book more than once in order to finish reading it. That's a wonderful convenience.  I use this a lot on the go since it's small, relatively light and easy to use. My iPad is much more cumbersome and heavy. It doesn't go too many places with me any more.  This Kindle will display the pictures in a book, but not all that clearly.  It's not made for impressive graphics.  I'm okay with that.  This is just a good, basic way to read books.  If you've been thinking of trying one out, go for it.  Amazon gives you 30 days to decide whether to keep it or not."
"231","I like to read at night without disturbing my wife. Unable to do that with this Kindle. And I don't like the backlit screens at night - glare is too  hard on my eyes. Needs to re-designed to plug in an led case. Love the E-ink! Please fix!"
"232","This kindle replaced my old keyboard style kindle when I fell and it went out of commission. I have had this one for about three weeks.  I love this new version but am having some frustration with the touch screen It has a hair trigger and too often I find wikipedia and other stuff popping up when I only wanted to turn the page. Sometimes it goes forward when I want to g back, and although I consistently set it to the font size I need, it somehow changes even when I am sure I was holding it only by the cover and not touching the screen. I have been using a kindle for about four years and would hate to do without. I assume that my new touch screen kindle and I will soon be comfortable friends."
"233","I am very disgusted with the Kindles with the touchscreen.  A friend gave me a Kindle several years ago and I loved it.  It did give me good service for years before it finally just gave out.  The Kindle I had, you clicked the side (either side) to turn the page.  I could not afford a new one so my daughter gave me hers and got a Kindle Fire.  Her Kindle is only about 2 years old and I hate it!  With the old one I could find the last page I read without any problem.  This one jumps around or jumps to the first of the book and you have to search page by page to find where you were.  Sometimes when you press to turn the page it doesn't turn the page or skips ahead several pages.  Sometimes I don't even have to touch the screen and it turns the page.  With my old Kindle I could delete books I have already read.  This one I can not.  Now the only Kindle you offer without having to touch the screen cost $199!  I thought the policy of any company was to make better products (not worse products) at better prices.  Not so with Kindle!"
"234","I finally got a Kindle because I had to take a 3-week trip to Rotterdam from California. I knew I would never be able to carry as many books as I would need, especially since we were going to need to carry a number of things back with us. It was a long flight with layovers both ways, and sleeping was nearly impossible in the cramped plane.I loaded the Kindle with e-books (I had a collection by one of my favorite authors, and there are lots of free books to download, and I decided to try Kindle Ultimate while I was at it) and packed it into my computer bag. It saved my life during the flight and the trip both. My husband thinks I should have gotten the one with its own lighting, but now that I'm home again, access to a reading light is not an issue.The text is amazingly clear--really, my graphics geek husband marveled over it--and being able to adjust the size means that even if I've forgotten my reading glasses, I can still read. (They don't always make it from one room to the o... Read more"
"235","i wish that i could rate the kindle that i received  ....BUT I CANT EVEN FIGURE OUT TO OPEN ONE OF MY BOOKS"
"236","I've long been an e-reader skeptic.  However, after finally trying my wife's Kindle, I decided I had to get my own.  I'm thrilled with it, and here's why:Travel:  I read a lot, and I read fast.  I usually go through a book in the course of the plane flight alone.  Add a couple more books to cover the flight back and the trip itself, and the weight and volume start to add up.  With the Kindle, I can bring a dozen books and take up less than the weight and volume of one!Finding new authors: I found my favorite authors by borrowing books from the library in my teens.  Now that I'm in my forties, a lot of them have died or retired, and I've read everything they wrote.  New books are too expensive to gamble with beating Sturgeon's law, and with two kids I don't have the time to get to the library.  With the kindle, I can check out lots of library e-books without leaving the house, and find my next generation of favorites for purchase!"
"237","I expected more!"
"238","I was disappointed that there was no screen lighting to allow reading in dim or dark environments. I ended up sending my kindle back and buying the paper white version that includes back lighting. $40 more seemed steep for that one feature but I really wanted it. That being said I love my Kindle Paper White!"
"239","I bought this on ""prime day"" (aka ""grandmas got for candy for you, oh wait that's just sugar free mints"" day), but should have just gone with a paperwhite (which would have been nice if they had put that one on sale!) I bought this one for me and a paperwhite for him. This one feels cheap, and the plastic on the back is hard whereas the material on the back of the paperwhite is smooth and is almost a rubberized serface. Also, it actually is MUCH nicer to have the light options of the paperwhite. The paperwhite feels much nicer and looks much nicer with the higher resolution screen and optional light. If you can afford the extra money just get a paperwhite, you'll be glad you did."
"240","This is my first e-reader, and I LOVE it.  The touch screen is so convenient, and it keeps my place in the books I am reading.It's true the screen is not lit from within, but that's not a problem for me, as I don't like to read in the dark!  It's very easy to operate, and anyone could learn how to use it in no time at all.  I'm very pleased with this purchase, and I will purchase more Kindles in the future!"
"241","Not bright enough."
"242","This was much better than I thought it would.  I think I could have like some better instructions though being a first time kindle users.  It took some time to figure it out.  All in all I lover it.  I would recommend this to everyone.  This is a kindle to read, so don't think you will be able to internet stuff with it like a tablet for those of you that are use to that.  I can read outside with the sun and lot of light with no problem.  I got a light light to attach for the dark areas ( or it could be my eyes)"
"243","sent it back"
"244","I bought this as a gift for someone haven't opened it yet but I just wanted to say that the box it came in had no packing peanuts or padding of any kind. Just the small kindle box in a bigger box. Please pack better. Especially electronics"
"245","It's really sad that a company try so bad to your customers in Spain and charge them twice on their cards and make excuses to return the incorrectly charged. Now we depend on ""Master Card"""
"246","I love that Kindle Touch is still anti-glare. it's what I love best about it. The screen doesn't hurt my eyes which is very important for me. The touch screen is superfast. You barely have to touch it. It's very responsive.I only have issues with the font size and the wireless. I wish there was a font size between font size number 5 and 6, like in my first kindle. Font size number 5 is either too small or font size number 6 is too big. There is no middle ground.Plus, I wish there was a simple Turn Wireless Off option like in my first kindle rather than the Airplane Mode. Otherwise it's pretty cool."
"247","This model is bit disappointing compared to my previous one with the physical keyboard. This model has many defficiencies copared to the old one, the worst of which is that it consistently flips pages on own which is very anoying. I loved my old kiddle with the keyboard and wish it were still available (new) for purchase. I am not agaist new technology but they went backwards with this one."
"248","Hardware: The dimension is just right and it is really light. The non-reflective screen surface ensures that this device can be used under various light conditions.Software: It has minimal features and thus is really good for users who are easily distracted by apps etc. The sole reading function makes this reader a must-have!"
"249","I got this as a gift and it is worthless, you can not adjust the light, it's to dark and can not read anything without eye strain. I can not return it because it has been opened.  I Even handed it to others and they said the same thing it is to dark.  It's hard to believe a device in this day and time it does not have a brightness option."
"250","Still too soon to tell"
"251","If you enjoy over paying for what basically feels like left overstock, buy this Kindle.If you want a smaller, more legible Kindle, get the paperwhite. I actually thought I was buying that one. Didn't think these were even made anymore.Great case of buyer beware!"
"252","I love it! I got this as a promotion on Amazon where they let me split up my payments and Im so glad I took the offer!Im able to connect it on wifi and also i can use it with my Overdrive app and download library books to the device. The only downside to this is that it dont have a light but I ended up getting a light from Amazon that clips on it. I still would much prefer a lighted on, but I couldnt afford it and Im glad to be able to get me a glare free device. I would recommend this for vacations and long trips if you are a book lover"
"253","I didn't like touch screen before but this one is so easy, just touch the screen with a gentle press of your finger and the page is turned. Better than the Kindle Fire I bought for my husband a couple of years ago. I also like that I can turn off and turn on theWi-Fi."
"254","USB Drive Mode makes no sense"
"255","My Kindle came before it the date given which was an added bonus. After tinkering with it for a bit, I have come to love it. It was easy to obtain the books from the Cloud and store onto the device. It also has a super simple user interface, which is what I was looking for. This does not have a back light, which I was aware upon purchase, but thought that it should be stated. The dictionary and highlighting options work well and I am rather impressed with them as well. The batter lasts for some time and as an avid reader, I find this to be extremely helpful. I like to read several books at once and have plenty of options, so if you are the same and travel a lot, this is something that is wonderful. I will update my review after a few more months to see if it stands the test of time. I expect the battery life to go down a bit, as all electronics, but so far I am impressed with this Kindle."
"256","did not like this one at all."
"257","It just wasn't what I needed"
"258","I used to read books on my phone, and I was really missing out. Reading on a kindle is a completely different experience, and I love it. The screen is a great size, and perfectly light to hold with one hand. The touch controls are responsive. Settings are simple and everything is fuss-free. This is much closer to how one might read an actual book - without the interruption of text message and email alerts, on pages that look so much like ink and paper. And the battery lasts for weeks!"
"259","Disappointed that it is not in color !"
"260","Well below expectation. Poor quality."
"261","I was ""upgrading"" from an original Kindle that I've had for years.  I was nervous about the touch screen; would it be responsive like my ""click"" original one?  I was worried about the extras being accessible such as the type size, home screen, back button, etc.  However, all my fears proved to be nothing to worry about. This little Kindle is just great.  Just as easy to figure out and use. I love it! It is a great low-cost reader!~  I still love the Non-backlit option because I am more old-school as far as I want it to be more book-like.  I don't read my books on my tablet..I save them for the Kindle."
"262","Bought this primarily to have a non backlit device for reading before bed time as studies show that ambient lighting results in greater restfulness during sleep, similar to a book. This Kindle is this in bright light and low light situations, especially at the beach. The native browser was a surprise, now I have to resist the temptation to check my email while off the clock and on holiday. Pretty amazing battery life overall, even with the WiFi on. Screen refresh is a bit slow and annotating is clunky but given that a change goes for a couple of weeks, I am not complaining."
"263","No back light must read in a lit area"
"264","They are in Chinese and I can't get them to English."
"265","The screen is not lit so you can't read it at night.  Not a deal at all!"
"266","So far, I am not very pleased with it. Too small!"
"267","I didn't expect glare free to mean BLACK AND WHITE. Also a video poker game I have on my other two kindles doesn't show up on the new Glare free kindle. There seems no way  to speak with a kindle support tech, since tour web site or any of my orders show no phone number for said support. I am very disappointed eith this kindle. Now I know why it was $49.99."
"268","No manual came with it making it useless."
"269","I replaced my four year old basic (and quite dead) Kindle with this newer model.  It is sub-par.  It lags more, even with the same connection, and is of a cheaper quality.  There are no connections for a lighted case, and I am very angry about it.  This thing is dollar store quality, unlike the one it replaced, and if Amazon thinks this is a strategic ploy to get me to spend more money on a 'fancier' one...well that's an epic fail.  I'll be returning this piece of crap and switching to Nook.  I am so disgusted because I've been a diehard Kindle user since turning to the dark side of e-reading.You failed, Amazon."
"270","Just got my kindle yesterday and I LOVE it!!! I have tried to read on my kindle fire(s) but the weight was prohibitive due to my bad hand arthritis...I love the screen - very easy on the eyes. I am so excited to be able to read my favorite books and not be in pain. This is awesome and I wish I had bought it sooner!"
"271","The good:The matte screen is easier to read than a smart phone, so it's good for reading in long stretches. The touch sensitivity is good. The Kindle feels sturdy. The weight of it feels fine. The battery life is fine: I don't have to worry about it dying.The bad:I wish its case was not as slippery. I keep it in a cover, so it's not a big deal for me.It seems book collections made on it can't be imported to Kindle for PC, which makes it less useful. Making collections on the Kindle isn't fun.The experimental browser doesn't work as well as I want. It hung loading a site. I have read that mobile sites work better.The user interface could be better: A dialog box asking if I wanted something should have buttons saying yes or no, not OK and Cancel. But the UI is usable and it's out of the way when reading a book.Overall it's good for people who like to read a lot."
"272","This was a great purchase.  I had a kindle 2nd generation that I was very happy with.  I was reluctant to upgrade over concerns some of the reviewers stated regarding the touch screen sensitivity and clarity.  I was also concerned about registration and not having access to previous books I had purchased.  I also had concerns about charging the battery with the adapter I had for the kindle 2.  Anyway, after a couple of months of consideration and a little more research, my wife convinced me I should buy the new kindle (birthday present), and I am very happy I did.  It works great.  All of my concerns were unfounded.  First of all it is much lighter and smaller than the kindle 2 (without sacrificing screen size).  It is easy to navigate using the touch screen and the drop down menus.  Registration was seamless, previous titles are readily available on the amazon cloud, and the battery charger adapter works fine.  Great product for those who love to read.  Highly recommended!"
"273","I bought two of these just in time to take with me on a three-week vacation. Since I am now a published author with a book available for Kindle as well as a print edition, I thought I should get one of these. I've been wanting one for a long time, this particular model in fact. I have loaded all my manuscripts onto the Kindle and was able to review them and write notes. The experimental browser is, well, experimental I guess. I didn't buy the Kindle for the browser, so I'm glad that it had one at all. I was able to access Facebook, my bank's website, and other sites reasonably well. The Kindle introduced me to GoodReads, and I now have my author page set up there so people can follow me and review my book."
"274","returned it as it has no back light for reading in the dark"
"275","There is no resemblance to the kindle we purchased several years ago.  I can't get it to work and am very disappointed."
"276","First of all I should say that I do love my kindle. This is my third, before which I had a nook. And to date I think this is the best. I prefer this stripped down version to the fancier ones, because just as with a car, the more gadgets and added features there are, the more parts there are that may break. I would rather just read with the light on in the room than rely on a reader to light up for me. I am an advance reader, and I go through two or three books weekly. (The promise of a week of battery power is ridiculous, because it doesn't take into account how much reading one does in a given day.)Those of us with arthritis have been assisted tremendously by the kindle. Sometimes I select very lengthy works that would be huge if I had to handle the physical book. And because of arthritic issues I prefer this version of the basic kindle to the one I just wore out. Not having the buttons down the side, but relying on a touch screen instead, is far easier on the thumbs. And highlighting by touch is far easier on the hands than having to navigate to each individual letter, one click at a time. This version makes it far easier to access footnotes and the dictionary. But there are some kinks that still need to be worked out.I use the features constantly, since I am almost always reading a book with the intent of reviewing it. The touch screen needs improvement. Trying to highlight too far left or too far right sometimes causes the page to turn unexpectedly. Trying to highlight in the topmost 20% causes the tool bar to pop up. It is possible to highlight these areas, but one has to touch it exactly straight on and hold for a moment, and frankly it's a pain in the butt. In addition, the keyboard has a terrible auto correct bar. I have an Android phone that can guess what I want to type very early, but this one has no clue. When using the secondary keyboard for punctuation, the next word after the space bar is tapped should pop up as the main keyboard with letters but it doesn't; we must move it back manually every stinking time. And try the bookmark! One cannot just tap the upper right corner, because that will either bring up the tool bar or cause a letter nearby to be highlighted. The only way to use the bookmark, therefore, is by first bringing up the tool bar, then selecting bookmark, then tapping a third time to verify that one wants to place a book mark in the corner.For those that don't often use the features and just want to read the book and have the kindle remember your place, it's a pretty good reader. The text is clear, and the font size is easy to change without causing the paragraphs to go out of alignment.The insidious suggestion that we link our Goodreads account to our Amazon account is the worst potential invasion of privacy I can imagine. I began my to-read list, which has hundreds of titles, with the casual intent to read those books if I ran across them; it was never meant to be a wish list. Of course, all I had to do there is ignore the prominent invitation to link my two accounts, but it's worth noting.All told, if I were going to buy an e-reader again, I would still choose this one. I suspect it is the best on the market right now. But I do hope amazon will also continue to work out the kinks in the features."
"277","After making this upgrade all my notes and highlights in my most frequented book have been lost. My techie son spent a long time researching this online & trying to beat the problem, but to no avail. What's up with this vaunted whispernet? When are they going to learn what a young Bill Gates figures out long ago--that customers care much more about their data than they do about some factory's next new widget! Disappointed.After submitting this mostly negative review, I was contacted by Amazon asking me to contact their customer support number. After a long discussion with a very helpful agent, they confirmed that when books are updated on their system, personal notes and highlights are lost. They gave me a website where I can go to see them once I'm logged in (https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights), but they will never again show up on my Kindle device. Strangely, my old notes & highlights show up on the Kindle app on my iPhone. New notes and highlights show up on my Kindle. But I cannot see all of my notes & highlights on either my Kindle device nor on my iPhone.I asked the Amazon agent if they never thought of allowing customers to elect to upgrade to newer versions of books they own with the declared risk that they may lose their own valuable data. The agent said they will put that into their system for consideration.So, I reiterate what I said before. Personal data is more important that hardware. If Amazon wants us to stick with their hardware platform, they better find a way to protect my data. In the meantime, keep your notes & highlights on paper!"
"278","I think 6"" is too small for a reader. it's hard to hold the thing without turning pages, and its awkward holding it with the edges.  BUT being able to read out in the sunlight is the best and why I gave it 5 stars.  Amazon has made the kindle universe rather convenient for a person that always reads.  I like the kindle apps on my notebook and phone, but I always take the kindle reader with me when I travel."
"279","Nothing like what I expected especially from Amazon. Do not get this kindle."
"280","For the price of the tablet, I was expecting it to come with a glowlight."
"281","didn't know much about this but it does pretty much what I hoped"
"282","I received the new kindle as a Fathers' Day 2015 gift from our youngest son. He gave me the kindle glare-free touchscreen. It improves reading experience in several ways. It saves reading state more often, allowing me to reliably switch to my old, original kindle--that I still use. The new kindle is more readable and certain commands are more intuitive. It is faster to connect with WiFi and I don't miss the ""experimental,"" ultra slow, and unreliable browser in the old kindle. However, I do miss side mounted page-turn buttons. This old feature allowed page turns forward and backward on both sides of the device, a feature that I've come to depend upon. Otherwise, I am hooked on my kindles. I now read many more books than I had read before I received both as gifts. I will not go back to buying paper books. I have a library that fits in my house rather than one the requires constant culling. Amazon makes book buying and reading the joy it was when I was a kid."
"283","I had paper white. Bought this as a gift. But returned because cannot justify giving an obsolete design as a gift, especially if it's for someone near and dear! It was great when there was no paper white. I think it will go out of production pretty soon."
"284","This is exactly what I wanted.  My eyes can't see small print as easily as when I was younger. My wrists would be stiff from holding my iPad if I read for any length of time. Also,  Kindle books on my iPad difficult outdoors due to the glare.This device satisfies those three issues I was having.  I can easily adjust the size of the print, reducing my eye strain.  The device is deceivingly light-- a pleasant surprise, and I can comfortably read for hours. In fact, the device is lighter than any paperback book.  Importantly, too,  the device allows me to read outdoors thanks to its glare-free screen.  Overall, it is easy to use. There is no learning curve required to become comfortable with the device; even my 90 year old mother found it easy to use. Bundling all these benefits together with the rather modest price I paid ($69), and I think it is an excellent bargain. I strongly recommend it to anybody facing the same issues that I was."
"285","Day one post,will update later if needed.:so far I like my Kindle a lot it is very simple and isn't overly complicated like some other tablets out there and instantly downloads books without any problems, I don't know why people don't like it, it is very simple and quite elegant and extremely light, it's actually lighter than my Samsung s5, I can see myself reading hundreds of books on this thing, and when I'm flying around the country which I do once in awhile it would be nice to have something that won't Eat through a battery in 5 seconds. I highly recommend this eReader.  Definitely get the $10/month Kindle unlimited, and maybe a led headlamp for hassle free nighttime reading."
"286","It's a great upgrade from my Kindle Keyboard!  Pages load faster and it is much lighter.  I think the feature I enjoy the most is the vocabulary builder, as it is helpful in learning new words.  I believe it's worth mentioning that this version does not have the text to speech feature nor a headphone input.  One thing I find questionable is the lack of a power charger, but the kindle charges on my cell phone charger so it's not a problem for me.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
"287","Although I had the first Kindle for at least 5 years, I am trying to give this one a fair trial.  One way that I can't become accustomed to is the way of changing pages.  This Kindle requires the little pen,type thing and even then it is sometimes stubborn.  Another way I find to take some changing, is the way the books are displayed with the book covers.  Since my eyesight is not strong, I liked the titles to be displayed in print.  As it is, I may be required to get a page enlarger/microscope.  Did the developers think of visually impaired people who are trying to read the titles in the contents?  Otherwise, this kindle is acceptable."
"288","Full disclosure-- I previously owned a Kindle Fire HD (that died very suddenly, and inexplicably after 2 years of gentle use), so my opinions on the Kindle Touch is after having owned a fancier model of Kindle.Over all, this is a good little e-reader. It does the job. It's small enough for me to hold & operate one handed (and I have small/medium sized lady hands). The font adjustment options make it easy to find something readable for your own eyes, and the paperwhite screen is wonderful. It's so nice to be able to read outside on a sunny day without glare making it impossible to see the words!! I love how light this little thing is, how portable, and how easy & straight forward to use.My biggest complaint is with the lag in doing... well... anything. Pages do not seamlessly turn, it takes a second or two to utilize the X-ray or dictionary features, etc. It's not a deal breaker, but having come from the Kindle Fire HD it's definitely something that I notice and am mildly irritated by. Also, I sort of hate that it's only black & white. Buying books, and seeing the full-colour covers in my 'library' is something that I miss.In general, this is just a MUCH more basic reading experience than what I experienced with the Fire HD. However, that is to be expected as the price is essentially 1/3 of what the Fire HD cost. Some trade off is to be expected, I suppose. I will say that having a more inexpensive e-reader (though lacking in some bells & whistles that I had grown accustomed to) is nice because I feel less worried about ""being careful"" with it, and babying it. There is a bit more freedom to be found with a device that doesn't cost hundreds of dollars.Over all, I would recommend this e-reader to someone who really just needs a BASIC e-reader that they can take on the bus, traveling, etc. It's portable, it's readable, and it very much does the job. However, if having something fancy & shiny is important to you, you may want to consider one of the Fire series readers."
"289","I would not have purchased if I knew I would be constantly bombarded with ads to purchase books. They should have paid me to purchase"
"290","I got this for my sister.  Can it be use with out WiFi. She don't have WiFi in her home"
"291","No back light for night time reading. Difficult to figure out how. to download books."
"292","The screen is small, Amazon should provide different options in term if screen sizes."
"293","I really haven't used it enough yet. I haven't downloaded a book yet. Still learning!"
"294","Sorry I found the Kindle very different from the Nook and I really didn't like it."
"295","Wanted a light and it didn't have one.  I should have read the description closer"
"296","sucks"
"297","I am still learning my way around with it, have ordered 2 books but have not been able to find them on my Kindle, hummmmso I have some learning to do yet"
"298","It is very small and there is no backlight. There is no comparison after using my iPad to read."
"299","I'm unable to do anything with it. Just read.  I'm unable to use dictionary for my own purpose. When I go to dictionary I'm unable to bring up keyboard.  I would like to transfer everything I had in my old Kindle, I have been unsuccessful there also. Completely frustrated.  I have read your Kindle Manual but I'm not able to go back to the problems I want to address at that one particular time.  I think I'm going back to my old K.  However, its screen has faded, this is the reason why I went for K 6.  On another subject can the screen on my old K be repaired.  I miss my dictionaries, Bible,etc."
"300","I have owned a kindle touch approx. 2012, and also a kindle paperwhite 2014.  But this device took away the ""home"" button which is so helpful.  Then they took the screen and shoved it up an inch so the screen is no longer centered on the device.  I hate both these things about this and none of my other covers will fit it anymore because of that stupid wasted space at the bottom.  The guts of the device are still good its just I keep pressing dead space where there should be a home button (which is now only touch available.)  The whole thing is a bad design.  I actually prefer my older model (Kindle Touch- which also has the capacity to convert your books to audio.... a very robotic voice but its still helpful if you need to be hands free.)"
"301","I am addicted to my Kindle! I love having a home library, filled with physical books at my fingertips whenever I'm researching. However, having a Kindle is wonderful for reading novels! I never got to read many novels because much of my life has been spent in the textbooks. With the Kindle I am able to pick a textbook or novel out and read it without having to hold up a book and manage the pages and keep it from being at a bad angle. I still prefer physical books for researching, but maybe there is an adjustment period for me. The kindle is always at a good angle, is light weight and the screen is great on my eyes! I have had an astigmatism for most of my life and reading has always caused headaches, so enjoying reading is something I never experienced until having the Kindle. I got this Kindle as a test to see if it would be a good gift for my daughter for Christmas, and we also purchased the paperwhite to see the difference. I, myself, like the basic kindle better than the paperwhite because of the balance to it's weight overall and the screen. However, I decided that I would give my daughter the paperwhite for Christmas this year since she can read things with the light whereas I have a difficulty with lights. My daughter likes to read in bed at night with just a night light and the paperwhite will be perfect for that. She was upset when I told her we could only keep one and the paperwhite had to go back (I really just wrapped it to give it to her after we decided she would enjoy it).After purchasing two kindles, we ended up getting a third one for my mother who loves it as well!"
"302","I have a kindle fire and love it but can not use it outside.  I use it in the middle of the night, without turning the lights on, when I wake up and can't go back to sleep.  I bought the paper white to replace the kindle fire but I find that the model that I bought on amazon day for $69 is the cheap model that does not adjust the brightness.  Very disappointed.  Seems like a bait n switch to me."
"303","Its called a kindle but it doesnt even lite on fire good at all. I expected a much better fire for the price."
"304","Returned.  Ordered one with a light.  Cannot read this one in bed with light off...the screen goes black."
"305","I like this kindle. Obviously this is not the backlit version, so don't expect to read it in the dark. Connected to Wifi on first try and loaded my e-books onto it with no issues. Touch screen is fine for me, not too sensitive. I bought the ad-version since it was cheaper, no issues for me. When ads are on the screen, I'm not using the Kindle so it doesn't affect me. I got this on sale for $49, so it was a steal :)Minus 1 star for the plastic backing, which makes it very slippery to hold. I don't plan to buy a case, so this was a negative for me. Perhaps if they used a different material on the back so gripping it wouldn't be so difficult (no, I do not want to buy a case just for this)."
"306","LOVE LOVE LOVE our kindle...this is our 3rd purchase for another family member.  I have personally owned a kindle since the day they launched them many years ago.  Not only do I love that it is like reading off regular paper and print but I can also read it directly in the sunlight just like a real paper book.  Choose a great leather cover and it is even better than a paper book!  As well, Amazon.com has fabulous customer service...any time that I have had an issue with a kindle (which is rare), they immediately solve or replace the device.  BEST purchase ever!"
"307","This is my 4th Kindle. I've only had the keyboard version until now, but I took the chance and ordered one during Prime Day. It's smaller than the keyboard version and I'm just getting used to the new device layout, but so far it's working great. My current Kindle keyboard was purchased used and with Special Offers. I decided to pay to have the offers taken off, so whem]n the time came to choose this model, I paid a little more to get a device without the special offers. The SO aren't intrusive at all, it was just my preference to get a device without them. So fae Im pleased. The touch interface does take some getting used to as I am used to physical keys to turn pages, but so far that's my only complaint."
"308","Love it!  Very glad I got this version, without the screen light (and without the ads).  I deliberated long and hard comparing this model with the Paperwhite, the Kindle Fire, Nexus, Kobo, Nook, Samsung, etc.  I previously had a 2010 Nook and then later, a 2012 Nexus 7. Comparing the two dedicated e-readers, I like this way better than the Nook.  Battery is far superior, page-turning is better and it's considerably lighter.  I chose to go with this as opposed to a Nexus or Kindle Fire because I didn't really need it for web surfing or email; I have my smart phone and my 12"" computer to perform those functions.  I wanted the very best e-reader, with the longest-lasting battery, and I feel that is what I got. Kindle, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-FiLove, love, love the fact that I can read it outside in full sun and can easily see the screen no matter how much glare there is.  I've only had it just over a week, so can't comment yet on its durability.  But it sure is lightweight, very easy on the eyes, the page-turning function is easy and reliable, and the battery is superb. I'm retired, with plenty of time to devote to reading now that it's winter, and this first week I read an average of 8 - 10 hours a day, and the battery still lasted me OVER A WEEK.  Really looking forward to taking this on our upcoming cruise, where cell phones don't work and  internet time on the ship costs $42/hour, so this handy device is bound to save me from boredom --because I don't plan to be online much at those prices!  If you just want something for reading books, don't want to spend a fortune and don't want to have to even THINK about your battery, this is the one to get!  By the way, I signed up for Kindle Unlimited at $9.99/month, and I'm absolutely loving it.  It's totally worth it, and it's such a pleasure to ""buy"" with one click and have it magically appear on my Kindle within less than 30 seconds.  No more downloading, saving, finding, copying and all that.  Just click the book you want on Amazon and presto, it appears on your Kindle and you can start reading.  It really couldn't be easier."
"309","I love this.  I have always prefered the plain Kindle over the color ones, but after reading Kindle books on my touch-screen smart phone I missed the ability to touch a word to find its definition.  This Kindle exactly meets my needs - I can use touch-screen for those features, but it still is small, portable, and one charge lasts several weeks. All the benefits of the original, with a touch-screen - and the right price. I highly recommend it."
"310","Can't see to read it! I must be a dummy because I can't figure out how to change the brightness! Wished I didn't buy it."
"311","In attempting to encourage pre-readers I mistakenly bought this product.  Be advised that it is in black and white only."
"312","It doesn't light up to read at night and it isn't in color and you can't play games on it. I wasn't very impressed"
"313","extremely had to operate. problem here, problem there.  would not have purchased if i had know how it operated."
"314","I've had my new Kindle for a few weeks now, and I LOVE it.I had the 5th generation before, with the side buttons and the ones on the front. It wasn't dying, but I wanted an upgrade and I was able to give my old one to my kid sister so that she could travel with a library in her bag.The only issue I have with the touch-screen Kindle is that it seems to be almost TOO sensitive. I vape, and anytime my ""smoke"" hits the screen, the font size changes. I have no idea why this is, but it happens. The other thing is that anytime I set the Kindle down on a metal surface--like the side of my stove, or the metal wastebasket in my bathroom--it goes into standby mode.Honestly, I find these issues more amusing than anything, so I'm not too bothered by it overall.I am REALLY, REALLY happy with the Goodreads link system and the timer that lets you know how much longer you should expect to be on a chapter or the book entirely. Now when I'm reading a really good book and glance at the clock to calculate how much sleep I'll have before work, I can do it within a smaller margin of error. It helps with my neurosis.Overal, I'm loving this. I would recommend it to everyone. The glare-free screen is perfect. I couldn't do any of the back-lit screens because of my sensitive eyes, and this is a great way to keep my headaches in check and enjoy my favorite books in a light, user-friendly device."
"315","i tried to read on my iPad, Galaxy note 3 phone and 8 inch tablet....glare glare glare!  I purchased this on the not Black Friday Wednesday for $49. It is worth every penny.  I downloaded my library, and bought a light.  Is perfect in every way. As a ebook only.  Is nice and light weight, easy to toss in a bag and go.  Only 4 stars due to the font size continually changes with each opening."
"316","By far one of my best purchases! Each of my son's ages 9 and 11 had the Kindle fire and they read on it at home but they also were tempted to play their games on the fire too! This they now can take to school. They have used this so much and they are reading a lot more. I have recommended this to all parents I know."
"317","Had issues with the original one I got. The battery was going down super quickly, and the screen was unbelievably touchy. It was easy to work with Amazon and get a replacement, though. Happy to say the old one must have been a dud, because the new one isn't nearly as bad on the battery!"
"318","I love it. I previously had the kindle keyboard and it finally went kaput on me. I love the e-ink so I went with this one. I was leary of the paper white because of the backlight, I stare at a computer screen all day at work and I didn't want to feel like that was what I was doing at home too.This little gadget is a perfectly portable size, albeit a little thicker than the keyboard version, but nothing you can't get used to in a couple uses. The touch screen is responsive with no over sensitivity uses. I'm really enjoying it so far and the battery is holding up really well, still on the first charge after a week of daily use. I would definitely recommend! :) happy reading!"
"319","It was easy to set up, it charges quickly and very easy to use. It is lightweight and easy to hold. It is glare free which makes it easy to read without straining my eyes. It fits easily in my purse when I want to take it with me. It comes with nice features. I really like the dictionary. Very happy with my purchase."
"320","I love this device! It has given me back the pleasure of reading. I have a form of dyslexia that makes reading black words on stark white pages very difficult (Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome, or Irlen Syndrome); this device makes it easy for me to read and comprehend what it is I am reading because it doesn't have that blinding contrast on the page. And it is so convenient, I have so many books on it to compliment my varied interests, and I can carry them all around in my coat pocket. And my Bible is always at my fingertips.Reading a good book is now the pleasure it was intended to be."
"321","This is my second kindle my (first was the one with buttons 4th generation) very easy to navigate  has a new feature call good reads full of hardcore readers that they think they are expert in writing or something and some casual readers I didn't bother with it much my only problem is that if feels hollow like a big calculator and makes it feel kinda cheap which I understand was to make I light so you need to buy a cover for this to keep it looking good and feel good."
"322","So far it is ok . Not used to touch page and having a little trouble remembering the symbols. But u didn't  show one like I had that quit working."
"323","I've thoughoughly enjoyed two Nook ereaders over the last few years, however, both have eventually broken where the charging cord attaches to the unit.  Very frustrating when I have hundreds of books & samples downloaded on each.  Getting support for Nook is FRUSTRATING.  Very hard to communicate with overseas reps.  I was reluctant to change because of my extensive Nook library, but since I buy everything else on Amazon, this move made sense.  I LOVE MY NEW KINDLE!  It costs less than Nooks, is lighter, holds a charge for over a week, and has some cool features that I like.  Most importantly, you get more extensive definitions when looking up words, and they are then added to your own list of vocabulary words.  Dorky, but fun to look back over and see if I remember what the words I've already looked up mean.  I also enjoy the ""X-ray"" feature. I've compared a couple of ebook prices and they are cheaper through Amazon (than on Barnes &Noble). I was annoyed that Amazon charges for an ad-free version, so I bought the one with ads.  I don't mind them at all, in fact, have even clicked on few.  My ONLY complaint... Come on on Amazon and just include a charger!  That's kind of ridiculous to charge extra for something that should be included."
"324","Kindle products are of poor quality, don't last and use antiquated technology! Amazon doesn't stand behind them when they break...and they will."
"325","My first kindle died (after I evidently rolled on it a bit too hard). It was a Kindle Keyboard, and I had done over 500 books when it croaked.And now I have the new one, and I love it! Back in the book-reading business!BTW, I do like the interface. More akin to the Fire interface (my wife has one), less like the gopher interface of a long, long time ago, pre-www."
"326","there is no light in this kindle and i cannot use it at night. thats a waste and it should be made blatant that there are no light controls."
"327","Honestly I thought I was getting the newer daylight to dark version of a Kindle. This one is nice enough, but the other would have been greater because I use public transit and standing in the dark with nothing to read is boring. My old Kindle had a light built into the case that I really, really loved. Alas it (the Kindle) died after four years, and the case kept having issues with the little prong breaking off.I love the size of this Kindle; it fits more easily into my bag. The printing is really  nice. It is good. I just wish I'd scrolled down on the page to find the one I really wanted."
"328","It doesn't have a light or the ability to turn pages with a squeeze, but otherwise this Kindle has all the very cool features of the more expensive Kindles at a much lower price. I especially like that rather than having to jump around in the book and potentially lose your place, footnotes and end notes open in a window on top of the text. You can also open a window to flip backward and forward through the book's ""pages"" without moving off the page you are on. For reading longer books or nonfiction with footnotes these two features alone make this Kindle a treasure."
"329","We received the unit on time which is great, however one of the features that my wife loves wasn't available on this unit, mainly audio, that is text to speech feature. As her vision isn't as good as it used to be reading is more difficult and the text-to-speech feature was ideal. Will check to see if this feature is on other Kindles."
"330","I bought my mother a Kindle but I resisted buying one for myself for a long time because I like to read eBooks on my iPhone or iPad. However, Amazon offered a deal for Prime members which made this Kindle only $50. I thought it over and decided for that price, it would be nice to be able to read in direct sunlight and not have to worry about running down my battery after a couple of hours of reading, as it does on my iPhone. The Kindle I had bought for my mom was one with a keyboard and side click-buttons. I wasn't that keen on having that type of awkward navigation, but this particular model is a ""touch"" Kindle. When it arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too different from using my iPhone for navigation (in that you touch the screen to do this or that). I did have to go look at some tutorials online to get the hang of it, but it is fairly simple to use now that I know where to touch the screen for the Home page or forward and back pages. I like the size and weight. It is about like reading a paperback book, maybe even a little lighter. I can almost hold it in one hand and use a finger to turn the pages on the same hand, although it isn't as easy as with the iPhone for that.There are only a couple of things that I find annoying. The on/off button is on the bottom edge of the frame. I tend to hold a book (or Kindle) on the sides or bottom and I have accidentally turned it off while reading because my finger touched the on/off button. The on/off button would be better if it was at the top rather than the bottom. The other thing is that I can't seem to bookmark more than one page at a time. I am in the middle of a project of converting to eBooks more than 50 stories and novels from a series that is long out of print. These stories have been scanned and turned into editable text and proofed mostly on my computer, but I still find typos while reading on the Kindle. I want to be able to put a bookmark on each page that I find a typo on, so I can go to my computer later and fix them all at one time. I think I am supposed to be able to bookmark more than one page, but these eBooks I have converted myself don't seem to let me do that. If anyone knows what I am doing wrong there, let me know."
"331","Dislike"
"332","garbage"
"333","I liked my first one I ordered. Too bad it was stolen. Now finally that I got all my books downloaded, on  the second Kindle it's o.k. WHAT WERE THE SPECIAL OFFERS?"
"334","DO NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT AT ALL. CANNOT DOWNLOAD BOOKS FROM MY COMPUTER ONTO KINDLE...LIGHT IS VERY POOR AND CANNOT INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
"335","very basic machine for the money!  screen size is really smaill, which I knew the size when ordered but reading on it something else.  very disappointed"
"336","I been reading a kindle from about second generation and I love these devices. I stare at back lit devices all day at work so the last thing I want to is read off of one at night. The screen is very easy on the eyes and I can read for hours no problem. My only complaints is that some features are lost in the latest generation of my Kindle. Old active content (games mostly) don't work, I can't have blogs delivered, and the text-to-speech feature has been removed."
"337","It was great for a year. Now it will not load new books. It took 2 hours of online chat to get it to reload the books that I previously bought. I am giving 2 stars because I loved it when it worked, and after working with that amazing chat person,now I can read the prior purchases. But what's the deal with being able to purchase but not download new books? The Kindle has NOT been dropped or in any way abused. It won't hold internet connection, flips back and forth between queued and loading maybe 25-35% of a book. At the same time, the kindle app on iPhone and iPad is totally broken--books were wiped off the devices and cannot be downloaded. I have spent maybe only an hour on calls for this problem, and have gotten nowhere. The chat person said it was not something she could fix. Tech people have not called back as they promised, perhaps because I live overseas. I have done every possible reset, so don't tell me to do that. I have done so multiple times.Follow up months later: After the recent hardware upgrade, I had hopes. A few books downloaded as they should! Now it is back to having to download to computer and then drag to the Kindle. Even the download usually takes 2-3 tries before it is successful. It used to be easy. Now it is not. It is still handy once you get the books on it."
"338","I resisted eBook reading for years.  I didn't think I would like it and I was positive I would miss the tactile feeling of holding a book.  I am, by nature, a person who loves tradition, and there's a big part of me that doesn't want to see the loss of physical media for our entertainment.  The look, feel, and even smell of those physical objects is part of the experience.  Then I decided to try one.  My fingers were having a reaction to book paper and it was worth a shot.I took my Kindle on vacation and I love it!  Put a cover/case on it and it still feels nice.  The display is amazing and worked perfectly for comfortable reading under dim light, bright sunlight, and even a reading light at night.  I loved being able to zoom the text size in and out so that I could make it whatever was comfortable to read at the distance I wanted (or needed) to hold the Kindle away from me.  I also liked the weight; it light, but it's substantial enough that I didn't feel as if I were  carrying a toy.  All that plus I got to carry a whole lot of books with me, for a tiny bit of weight tucked in my carry-on laptop case.I'm hooked!"
"339","A decent product and works well. However, file organization is difficult:1) all files/documents have to be placed under the folder ""Document""2) If I create sub folder under documents to organize files/documents, it does not work--they all show up at the ""Document"" folder level3) the only way to group files/documents is to use ""collection"" for tag files/documents. But, tagging is not a intuitive way of file organization.Because the limitation of file/documents management, I become overwhelmed when I loaded 30+ files/documents. It became very difficult to find files.Somethings for next firmware release to enhance."
"340","I won't buy it without Text-to-Speech so I am disappointed. I have a cochlear implant and Text-to-Speech helps me to learn to listen. Why remove it on the new model. Put Text-to-Speech back!"
"341","The reaon I only gave it a 3 is because it's a great e reader but there are no games that can be played on it if a person needs a break from a book but needs entertainment to kill time."
"342","I ordered this Kindle and sent it back. I was very disappointed with the screen, it is way to dark and it can not be brighten up! So if your expecting  to be able to read in the dark, FORGET it. A separate light has to be purchased also, and it makes it more costly overall."
"343","I was assured that this model had back light.  I cannot locate how to turn it on.  I'm thinking it does not have that capability. That was one of the main reasons I purchased it."
"344","No. I made a mistake, I wanted the kindle so I could read while the lights were off and this model doesn't have the built in light. So Im stuck with it. Is very uncomfertable."
"345","While I like all the features, I also like to play games. The kindle is not compatible with one single game. Even  with the most basic kindle you can get a couple of games"
"346","The text is really easy to read.  I went with this one as opposed to the other ones because of the anti-glare, it reads like paper, and the battery life.  I didn't need all of the bells and whistles since I already have a 2-in-1 tablet.  It is very lightweight."
"347","came to me on time. but the language isin chinese and after youtubeing it it doesnt have a language setting.... and customer service was no help. i am very dissatisfied."
"348","I bought this Kindle ereader as an upgrade to my older, 3rd gen Kindle ereader. I do love this new, 7th gen ereader and have only one complaint. Scrolling through all my ebooks on the cloud (almost 5000 books) is a long, tedious process to get to the book I want. The search feature doesn't always work well. I think Amazon could do alot better in that area. But, other than that, I do like the 7th gen. It has way more storage and you do have your cloud books available to download easily. The battery charge lasts longer than the 3rd gen and the touch screen works well."
"349","This is my second Kindle!  Yep, Loved my first one to death!!  :)  This replaces my original model KeyBoard Kindle.  I love how easy it is to use and hold in one hand.  Lightweight but sturdy, perfect for this avid reader!  I haven't come close to filling it up with books and love all the different options for font size and sync abilities.  So I recommend this to everyone who wants a reader.  Nothing heavy, nothing over-sized or so many complicated apps and options you  want to scream!  Simple but perfect!"
"350","The ability to read the text is about the same as my first Kindle, which I still have. But, all the effort to make it more jazzy has resulted in it being harder to navigate. On my keyboard Kindle the books I have active in my library are listed in text. One look and I can see 10 of the books I have that I intend to read.Flip to thr next page and I can see 10 more. All I have to do to call one up is to highlight it and push the OK button. When I'm done and want to archive the boo,k that is easliy done and it no longer appears in the list. If I want to recall an archived book all I have to do is go to the archive listing and recall it. Simple, straightforward. To find a book with the touchscreen display I have to navigate through many books, depicted as book-covers, to find the book I want. If you have a number of books in the queue, that is time consuming and frustrating.  And, I can find no easy way to recall a book that has been deleted from the bookshelf. Snazzy graphics but a lot more work. On the plus side, the battery lasts longer. In the end, I like my keyboard Kindle better."
"351","The Good - We got this item on sale so the overall pricing worked for my family. The adjustable fonts and bookmarks work very well. Like how some books will tell you how much time you have left, at your current pace, till you finish the chapter.The So-So - Every now and again when you turn the page it just gets lost and you find yourself 3-4 pages beyond where you expected. Hard to reproduce this issue but 3 people in my family have had it happened to them.The Bad - This device has a known wifi issue. My netgear wifi spot supports, Compaq XP laptop, HP 7 laptop, Xubuntu laptop, android tablet, chumby, a friends mac book, an HTC rythme and ironically the B&N Nook but this kindle will not connect. Talked with Amazon support and went through the entire process but nothing worked. Has something to do with long passwords and not broadcasting the SSID.  That's why I gave this device 3 stars.We decided to keep it because you can download the books via USB cable and we are going to buy books anyway so the difference in price (paper vs ebook) will cover the kindle in 15 books. Just wish the wifi would work."
"352","Loved my old Kindle Touch. I feel like I've ""downgraded"" with this. It's much more difficult to sort and access docs and books than in the old system. Don't get me wrong it works fine, but I don't feel that it's nearly as user friendly, which surprised me. You have to choose collections or books by recent you can't get both. Frustrating to me.  I've had 6 Kindles and I am less happy than ever with the newer software and device.  Other than that great battery and other options. Miss the audio as well."
"353","My arthritis in my hands was making it difficult to hold my Kindle Fire HD and even books.  This new kindle is wonderful!  It's easy to hold, super light wait and very easy to read.  This new kindle is now number 4 in my household.  Wonderful product!  Thanks"
"354","No light."
"355","This is my 6th kindle I had to replace two of them one 6 inch and one fire but I have enjoyed eas of reading for the last 5 years need two because the fire can't be read in sunlight at the beach"
"356","i had a problem with my screen 15 months after my purchase. Impossible to switch it on again. This is NOT A RARE issue! The only thing the customer service proposed me was to buy a new one with 10$ off.disappointing!"
"357","I wanted an e-reader that I could read outside in the sun. This is perfect for that. I do miss having a backlight and may end up getting the kindle paperwhite but for now this is wonderful. I do have a Fire Tablet that I can use indoors in the evenings when the light is dimmer. But the tablet's battery length is not good so I prefer to read with the kindle that has an excellent battery life."
"358","We got this for our 5 yr old for Christmas.  I love that she can use her kindle free time on it and read all of those books also.  She's a beginner reader, but she can't put it down and loves it.  This is just a starter one for her, to make sure she will take care of it before we upgrade her.  I really like how I can leave the free time on, so that when she turns it on, it's already on the freetime and she needs a password to get out of it.  Can't make any purchases while its on free time."
"359","I have a Kindle fire and a Kindle HD, neither of which are easy to read outside in full sun light.  With a special offer on the Kindle 6"", I got a very good price for a simple reader that I can take to the beach with me, or outside on my lunch break and read to my heart's content under sunny skies.  I have not yet used all the extras on this one, but it's just what I was looking for."
"360","i want to return it"
"361","I have one of the very first Kindles and I love it!  I have always loved to read and over the years I have kept my Kindle very busy.  I received my Kindle as a gift from my daughter at a time when my eye sight was getting poor.  I was diagnosed with ARMD and was finding it hard to enjoy my books.  Kindle to the rescue!  I was able to go into the kindle and increase the print size to one that I was able to see and I have been able to continue enjoy a hobby I have had all my life and I don't have to go hunting for the books I want to read to be published in to large print format.  I can do it myself and read what ever I want.  I would not give up my Kindle for anything."
"362","I finally bought a kindle after having a nook for several years. As a prime member, I thought this would be a good value.The kindle is composed of a hard slippery plastic with angled edges.  This configuration is unpleasant to hold and requires a cover. The nook has a rubberized back with smooth corners which is comfortable to hold.The touchscreen of this device is not very responsive and requires that the reader forcefully jab the screen. My nook is quite responsive .As a prime member, I looked forward to borrowing books as part of my subscription.  The selection is disappointing.Although I have not used this service yet, borrowing from the public library straight to the device is stated to be easy.  This compares to the nook- books must be downloaded from a PC. All in all, the new kindle is lacking, even compared to a 4 year old nook. I am deliberating returning this device."
"363","not kid friendly."
"364","Can't brighten screen"
"365","No thank you"
"366","This device is great and lightweight! I was very interested in purchasing a Kindle when they first came out and I was still in school so I didn't have the funds. I recently received this for my birthday and I was able to use it on my trip out of town. I downloaded a ton of books and was always able to pull it out when I was bored or waiting."
"367","The  new Kindle often does not reopen at the last page read, and does nor always retain the font size that I prefer when I turn it off and reopen it. Both very annoying. My old one never behaved that way. In fact, I complained about it - I think its a defect, and was told someone would get back to me, but nobody ever did."
"368","Don't care for the touchscreen, in fact, it sucks! You morons made it bigger! It won't fit in my breast pocket and is a squeeze in the hip pocket. Touchscreens are for millinial morons. You had a good product and you bowed to internet opinion Morons!"
"369","Returning it. It should be $20 product."
"370","Can't read it at night"
"371","I had the old, original Kindle and dropped it off the table. I absolutely loved it and mourned it's loss. I upgraded to a Kindle Fire but this Kindle was on sale so I bought this too as a back up / extra for the family. It's better than the ""old"" one since it's touch screen. I sitll use it at times over my Fire since it holds a battery charge longer."
"372","Should say you can't see it in the dark on the technical specs."
"373","like my new kindle!"
"374","Piece of crap!  I had kindle fire that charging port went bad on, so i get this since i mostly just read with it anyway.  I have not had it on 2 minutes and i hate it.  There is an ADT ad on the lock screen (not just lock but the permanent idle screen so long as device is on that's what you see) and when it unlocks there is an ADT ad at bottom of home screen.  Are you freaking kidding me.  ADT has nothing to do with reading and it's an ad on a device that good money was paid to have.  On top of that the screens are not seamless, there is a flicker that occures when you change pages.  CRAP!  Don't waste your money and if you got it for christmas get the gift receipt!"
"375","easy to use. light weight"
"376","I love my Kindle. It's so easy for me to carry everywhere. Easy to read under the sun at the beach, great while you are waiting at your doctor's appointment and for me in particular I love to download my college notes into the kindle to take everywhere and study whenever I have the chance without having to carry my computer or have my eyes irritated by the glare of my tablet. I used to have a previous generation kindle and the only complaint I had about it was that it was tedious to go through the words with the up and down arrow to highlight something or write a note. This is solved by this generation with the touchscreen... Such a timesaver."
"377","I am really still adapting. I had a kindle a few years ago and it seemed easier to navigate and the pictures were clearer. For night reading I use the iPad kindle app which seems easier to navigate too.So, the big appeal is the non glare screen for now. Great for deck,poolside and the beach."
"378","Smaller than my old one."
"379","Not at all what I expected.  Returning it."
"380","I bought this for my nine year old granddaughter, she absolutely loves it. Easy to use for a child no glare the size is great very pleased with this item. This was a Christmas gift. Easy for a nine year old to use. I will probably upgrade when shes a little older to a tablet but this is very good for her age."
"381","I have been reading Kindle books on my iPad mini for a couple of years now, and it's OK. Just when I'm outside or at a conference that it's truly horrible. When the e-ink 6"" Kindle went on sale for $50, I jumped on it. Man is that screen nice! I have grown tired of freemium games and don't use Office on my iPad as much as I used to. So, between this Kindle and my cell phone, I really don't have to tote around my iPad as much anymore.Sooo glad I made this purchase!!"
"382","'called help and received zip."
"383","This is my perfect Kindle and I'm enjoying it as much as i can.  Glare-Free is the one for me.  Sure I had to get a lamp but it's easier on my eyes then that lit screen.  I'm more than happy!  Thanks!"
"384","I love it! Ok, I read .... a lot. For me it is an experience. The way a book feels in your hands, the smell of the pages and of course the story itself. This kindle reads very much like a book. While I don't get the full on ""experience"" that I so love ... I still have no complaints about it at all. It cuts down on the clutter to because I don't have so many book shelves of books, how ever I do still buy my favorites as a physical book. Great job Amazon ..... now all it needs is that new book smell. ;-)"
"385","I am in LOVE with my Kindle! I've had it for 24 hours and I cannot put it down! It's lightweight and easy to use. I can navigate through my book list, wish list, and the Special Offers on the Kindle. A cool feature that I found myself using is the Dictionary feature, where I'm able to have a word defined in a matter of seconds. Although it doesn't have the built-in light, the Touch can be used in fluorescent lighting or natural - there truly is no glare.I highly suggest this E-Reader for all readers! From the ""not so much of a reader"" to the ""bookworm"" - it's an amazing product that everyone will fall in love with!"
"386","My new kindle is so much lighter than my old one and the plastic case will be good for my fingers in the middle of winter (The metal case of my old one gets really cold).  I really like the new way to turn it off and I have been using it for a couple weeks straight and haven't had to recharge it yet. I am waiting to see how long it will go with one charge."
"387","SCREEN IS SO DIM I CAN HARDLY READ IT."
"388","Wrong one ordered by me. I returned."
"389","did not realize it want work in dark"
"390","Good price but not a lighted screen!"
"391","This does not fit my kindle device."
"392","Great little device.  I got it for my elderly mother and the screen seems to be extremely sensitive.  If she barely hovers her finger nail over the screen it will change.  She finds this very frustrating.  I hope they come out with a way to make it not quite so sensitive so those who are older can use it more effectively.  For me it works great!"
"393","My Kindle,6 doesn't recharge at all"
"394","I've used the Kindle app on my phone for years, but always found the temptation to do other things too strong, especially when those email notifications pop up.  The glare-free display isn't completely glare-free, but does well--especially compared to the glossy screen on my phone.  The lack of a backlight could be seen as a detriment to some, but I see it as preventing sleeping problems that may be linked to the blue tint of most LED backlights.The ads are not too bad since I have a case, but I still might pay the extra to remove them.  I'm definitely a satisfied customer!"
"395","If you haven't used a Kindle before, let me tell you: This device is going to feel weird. It really does look like a paperback book, with the slightly-off-white display. If you're expecting it to look like a tablet, well, it doesn't exactly. No, this device looks like a book - but with electronic programming that allows it to actually be hundreds or even thousands of books.This Kindle was my Christmas present to myself, and I am delighted. I had low expectations as it is a budget device - if you want something with more features, you're going to have to shell out more money. But if you're looking for an inexpensive way to collect books and carry them all in a single pocket, this will get the job done.Edit, for more information:I've been using my Kindle for 16 days now - and still have yet to charge it. For this reason alone, I see it as a valuable investment. It's an electronic, but it's not something I'm going to have to remember to charge. I read almost every night on this thing and I still love it. Every single e-book makes me more satisfied with my purchase."
"396","I have enjoyed reading Kindle Books on my iPad and later my iPad Mini for quite some time. My problem with these devices has always been the weight when reclining in bed. This Kindle solves that problem because it is much lighter and with a little ingenuity, I have really improved on it. A Silicon Bracelet fits nicely over one edge to insert my ring and pinky underneath in the back leaving my birdie finger and index to steady the top. My thumb is free to effortlessly turn pages while my left hand can work the menus if needed. I added a matching bracelet to the other side for an even look that doubles as a rubbery protector."
"397","I bought this kindle for my mother for Christmas. I didn't want it to have a lot of bells and whistles on it because she is nervous about electronics. She has had it for over a week now and only had to have me come over and ""fix it"" as she says, once. I am very happy that it looks like a real book as she loves to read. It was a good purchase and has made her happy for Christmas. Thank you Amazon for your amazing products."
"398","I was disappointed it had no interior light"
"399","I am not happy with the Touchscreen Kindle"
"400","Returned it and ordered a Kindle fire hd."
"401","i like to turn the pages with the button."
"402","I love it! My husband and kids got it for me for mothers day. It is exactly what I wanted in a e-reader. I have had several different tablets including the kindle fire and I just didn't like all the extra stuff. I ended up giving one to my mom and the other to my oldest son. The fire and other tablet i had was too heavy, they were useless if you were outside and I didn't like the constant notifications for games, email, and such. The kindle e-reader is super light weight and very comfortable to hold. It had a generic web browser if you wanted to do minimal web browsing but i see no need to use it. I love love x-ray! i also like the easy access to the store and good reads. If you want movies and games as well the fire is the way to go. we also have the fire kids and my youngest son loves it. I like it as well and you can switch it to an adult tablet which i will use if i want movies and such but that is not too often. However, i do not like all that extra stuff all the time. I want to be able to take my book with me and not have it take up too much room and be able read without interruptions. So if you do not want or need all the extra stuff and simply want to read wherever you go then this is defiantly for you."
"403","Love my kindles....this one is a gift!!"
"404","There is no brightness control.  Total waist of money if you ever read in lower light or dark.  To be honest, it is hard to read in regular light.  Page seems to dark.  This is my 4th kindle and I love all my other ones due to the ability to change brightness or paper white. I got this for the wi-fi for my daughter, but not even worth having it with no brightness.  She could just read the paperback if that is the case."
"405","I am enjoying the new Kindle. There's some adjustment comparing my old keyboard style with the touch screen. It is smaller so it fits in my purse better. No color but this is for reading only which is what I needed it for. Mine has the ads on it, no problem there either. It syncs in with my Fire and old Kindle. That's convenient but it has been a little confusing to get books on the new one from the old ones. But that may be a matter of getting used to the new system. If you just want to read books, this is perfect. If you want to get on the internet, get the Fire. Both are great."
"406","I've previously owned 2 used 1st Gen. Kindles and loved them until they died for lack of use (too much work, not enough time to read).  I splurged and bought the new Kindle 7, and I love it!  Took it to the lake over the weekend for a picnic and read the whole time.  It was sunny and warm enough for me to get a slight sunburn, but I never had a problem with glare on the screen. The touch screen display is awesome, and takes a little getting used to, but I love that, too.  Could have paid $20 more for the Kindle Fire, but for a person who spends10+ hours a day on a computer, that was the last thing I needed...I just needed a 'book' that didn't weigh 10 lbs (Stephen King) so that I could take it anywhere, anytime."
"407","I am the wife on the account. I have had several Kindles but this was the worst. Promised new features did not live up to expectations.  Miserable to use by being forced to change pages with one hand.  I have a second generation Kindle that does not have a lot of bells and whistles but  pages can be easily turned with a click of a button from either relaxed hand.  The screen is great and can be read in sunlight. Bring something like it back with all the best new features and then it would be worth buying another"
"408","Really great reader in the sun; almost think it's a better reader in the sun than in a normally lite room.  Very happy with the basic functionality of this model Kindle.  Have an iPad already and didn't want a reader with Internet access thereby enabling me to stray of course from reading periodically.  Doesn't actually ""flick"" pages like a book.  Instead there are (3) quadrants that you simply tap to change pages (fwd or back) or pull down main menu.  Overall it meets the needs of this basic reader (myself)."
"409","I've held off for years in favor of traditional books before finally breaking down and getting a Kindle. Granted, it's kinda bottom of the line but I usually start small, taking baby steps and I couldn't pass up the deal of $59 with payments broken down monthly. I mean!Well. After some initial fumbling and poking, I can honestly say ""Where have you been all my life?!?"" This goes just about everywhere with me and it has encouraged me to read more as I'd slacked off more than I was happy with. As a starter, I can tolerate the ads (for now) but my dream is to upgrade to a more substantial model that will allow me to do and see more.I was taken aback at first because, unbeknownst to me, the feature that shows you what other readers have highlighted was enabled, but I poked around some and saw how to turn that bad boy off. It was mildly interesting at first (Hmm... why would someone highlight THAT passage or line?) but quickly grew distracting/annoying. Still in all, I've been very pleased with the experience and have fun loading my Kindle up with all kinds of reading material that I wouldn't otherwise have taken a second look at in a hard copy.  I've also loved the readability of the test and the ability to make the font comfortable for my eyes. Until an upgrade is possible for me (soon pleasepleaseplease!) I will add a clip-on light so that I can read in dimmer light as well.So, if anyone else is still holding out on taking the technological jump into an e-reader, I say go for it! I still miss the smell of a new book at times but I can always go browse in the local mega book emporium.(Oh, and thanks to those who posted in their reviews about trying my phone charger before springing for a separate charger purchase <really Amazon?> because my Android charger works like a charm.)"
"410","Had to send it back.  Could not download games"
"411","I've had four paperwhites and have liked them so much that I've given each one away and bought another.This version doesn't have a backlight, which limits its utility to brightly lit spaces. I'm not sure which genius decided to cut out this feature, but he or she would be better served working in the fast food industry."
"412","I was disappointed that it does not have the ability for sound. I did not realize that when I bought it or I would have apply the money to one with sound."
"413","I would have preferred at some backlighting."
"414","Fairly good purchase. No headphone option???"
"415","DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO READ IN THE DARK!!!  You'll need to get the paper white."
"416","My wife and I have a couple of kindles, originally I wanted the kindle fire as you could also play Angry Birds on it and occasionally use the internet - but never used it much for this. The kindle fire has a battery that lasts only a day or two, the black and white kindle lasts weeks.Our son gave us for Christmas a year ago a black and white kindle where you have the backlight also.I bought this to replace the lost black and white kindle that my wife lost. After getting it, we realized that this has no backlight, that means no reading at night without a light. My wife loves to read at night and does not want to disturb me, I usually do not read at night, so I took this one and I gave her mine.Maybe it is a good recommendation to buy the more expensive model, but this works fine if you do not plan to read at night without another light source."
"417","The new Kindle was a huge disappointment as the device no longer supports audio!!  The only device that does both is Fire which does not have the anti-glare screen for outdoor reading that Kindle does.."
"418","After a Kindle fire I find this device insufficient"
"419","the product is ok to readbut  it was not very cheap"
"420","I loved my fourth generation Kindle because it was pretty much a no nonsense little ereader. It was also comfortable to hold for hours of reading pleasure. Unfortunately as such things go, it finally gave up the ghost and it was time for an upgrade. Hence, the seventh generation touchscreen. It's only been a week or so, but I've settled in with this one. The touchscreen is definitely a plus, the screen is crystal clear and glare free. Of course there are a lot more bells and whistles with it, such as Goodreads integration and the quick view. There were times I found such additions a bit fussy, but they're coming around. My biggest complaint is how much more weight this ereader has compared to my first. Even with the thinnest cover I could find, it's still an adjustment. For all that, it's still a nice little machine."
"421","waste of money i would of prefered to buy a tablet"
"422","I won this from an AARP contest. I was surprised when I received it and didn't use it for a while. It did come at a perfect time when my large Kindle Fire's battery stopped charging. I love how light weight and thin this is...it easily fits in my purse without weighing it down. I love how there's no eye glare so I can read it at night without the glare keeping me awake for a while. Turning pages is easy by swiping or pressing your finger on the right side of the page, although sometimes by mistake, I press too far to the left or swipe too close to the middle and a word or sentence is underlined and the dictionary pops up or tries to...frustrating. Scoring stars at the end doesn't show up on Amazon so not sure why it's there. Overall, I really like this kindle and suggest it to others, especially for night time reading!"
"423","Don't like all the advertising on my kindle!!!!!!!"
"424","no directions at all in the box. so it just sits."
"425","This is my 2nd kindle, I had the first edition kindle for years and left it out in the Sun too long a couple weeks ago. It sadly broke. I immediately went out to purchase another one and I was really happy the quality was still there with a couple new upgrades. I love the glare free screen. My kindle is one of my favorite items, and this didn't disappoint. I will say I think the battery life on this version isn't as great as my first one. Its probably because of the touch screen."
"426","I love my new Kindle!! The display is marvelous and the soul reason I will always stick to Kindle! The touch screen is great, and the whole set up is easy to learn. I wish the home display was was designed differently, but honestly I got it to read books not to stare at a home screen! Would absolutely recommend to everyone!"
"427","wasn't what I expected. Did not have a light up screen"
"428","Doesn't have a backlight for reading at night. Can't download and play word games like the original kindle could. But it's great for reading which is what it's intended for. The screen is a little touchy with swiping your finger to turn pages. But it's very easy to use and figure out. The battery lasts a very long time!!!! Would recommend for those who like to read and aren't into games/apps. Plenty of free books to search for when searching the amazon store. If you're upgrading to this device from an old kindle, it can upload previous amazon books you bought when you link your account."
"429","didn't realize the screen is not back lit. kinda lame"
"430","My expectations were not met.  Also, did not need it."
"431","I had a kindle keyboard. it died. My husband said  most people don't use theirs 5 hours a day for 4 years.  This one was hard to get used to. everything worked differently. But after whining and grieving the loss of my last one. I began to put my book into collections. I transferred my older books. I learned to love it.  I did not name it brad. but I thought about it."
"432","This is a great deal. It helps me go back to reading since its easy to carry and light. I can borrow all the books (if you don't mind waiting for some of the popular books) from the library.  Battery life is reasonable. Though I understand that it isn't possible to read in the dark with this version, I do wish I got the other one instead at night. But overall this is a great buy!"
"433","Ok"
"434","I don't like it nearly as well as the other kind of kindle..."
"435","t didn't have a light built in so I returned it.  C Bourque"
"436","Do not like it black & white .you have to use a light .lol"
"437","I just bought this kindle for  my 9 years old daughter 3 days ago , I still can't  buy or download books on it."
"438","It's okay. Obviously the Kindle Fire HD is much better."
"439","Loved this. Ended up breaking and I purchased a replacement, but I don't love the new ones as much as this simple one. Too many options on the new ones for me, the simplicity of this - no color, easy turn pages - were fine."
"440","I'll start by saying I really love the Kindle e-ink display and wouldn't use any other computer screen or reader. I don't even miss the side buttons, though I did like those on the previous version. My overall complaint is that this model seems much cheaper. The last generation non-touch screen that I had was a joy to hold in my hand, it fit perfectly, and I think the back was rubberized for a better grip and to not slide around on stuff. It was just wonderful to hold. The back plastic on this model is VERY cheap and slick, and while I enjoy the Kindle experience overall, I don't get the joy out of holding this device like I did the previous model. That being said, this version is much easier to use for highlighting and making notes, which is a feature I like and use frequently."
"441","My one star review is solely based on Amazon's decision to include ""Special Offers"" on their lower priced Kindle Touch (which is still, actually, not super cheap, typically running you about $80). My husband purchased the Kindle Touch for me from a retailer, and so, it automatically included what Amazon refers to as ""Special Offers"" that Amazon claims only kindle users are privy to. At first, the special offers were limited to Amazon products only (Amazon Fire TV stick, chargers, cases, etc) and although I was pretty disappointed to learn that my screen-lock pages consisted of basically a rotation of Amazon ads, it was somewhat tolerable (although I should note that these ""Special Offers"" were not special at all, as the price of each item displayed was actually the same exact price if not CHEAPER on Amazon's main website, which EVERYONE has access to). Occasionally, Amazon would throw a few book cover illustrations in the rotation, which was a nicer display (although it still displayed the price of the book so was technically an ad as far as I'm concerned).Then it took a turn for the worst! A few weeks later, my Kindle updated automatically, and with the update the ads became completely out of control. It was no longer limited to Amazon products but instead included ads from Asics shoes, Quaker oatmeal, Vitamin pills, ice-cream, life alert bracelets, and even blood pressure monitoring devices! And it was EVERY SINGLE TIME my Kindle was in screen-lock mode. The one book cover illustration that I did find in this new rotation even had an ad for the Land Rover in the bottom corner! When I unlocked my Kindle and went to the homepage, the same annoying ads were displayed in a banner at the bottom of the screen. Had I been able to return my Kindle, I would have (the retailer we purchased it from has a 14 day return policy). Instead, I took the route that I know Amazon hopes each person that buys the discounted Kindles will take; I bought my way out of them for an additional $20. And no, you cannot use an Amazon gift card to pay for the ads to be removed from your Kindle, as an Amazon customer service person formally informed me. Fortunately, my Kindle was purchased at a Black Friday special price, saving us about $30 total and making this $20 ad-removal fee a little easier to swallow.That being said, as soon as I paid the fee, the ads immediately disappeared from my Kindle Touch and I am MUCH happier with it, however I am completely appalled and disappointed with Amazon for taking on such shady business practices and making an E-reader that has all of visual appeal of a lame ad-supported free phone app."
"442","Just get a paperwhite. This has no light to it. It's stupid and pointless. That said, I LOVE my paperwhite, it's awesome."
"443","I am a long time Kindle user who has owned several of the models and bought several others for my family members as gifts.  I think this little Kindle is amazing.  I owned one of the first generation models when they first came out and I loved it and used it for 3 years until I was ready to upgrade to the Kindle Fire.  I was excited about the Kindle Fire and how it was like a tablet but quickly realized I didnt like the tablet part of it or the glass screen with the glare all the time.  Plus, it was really hard to type on the keyboard and on all 3 models of the Fire, the charging port wore out.  That just happened to me again and this time I saw this model on sale for Black Friday for $49 and decided I had nothing to lose trying it out.  It arrived the next day (thanks Amazon amazing customer service!) and was very easy to set up.  It comes with only a charging cord with USB plug now and does not come with the power unit that you need to be able to plug it into an outlet.  All of my other Kindles it was included but now it is sold separately.  Once I got it charged and turned on it only took a couple minutes to set it up and I was reading!  Note: this Kindle is not backlit.  It has no light at all so you do need a light to read in the dark.  I love this Kindle.  It is much lighter than the other models and the touch screen is really nice, you dont have to push a button to turn the page.  If you are an avid reader like me, who uses their kindle mainly for reading, this is a great device."
"444","I'll be honest, I miss my kindle keyboard.  I miss having a manual page turn, I miss the size and shape and I miss having the music option.  The new kindle touch is lighter, the screen is the same size as the original kindle, so it is slightly smaller lengthwise, but slightly thicker.  The screen itself is definitely better.  It is whiter and reminds me less of an etch-a-sketch. It operates faster, there is no delay in page turns.  It turns on the same way as an iPhone, where you push a button and then have to swipe the screen just right.  Obviously it doesn't have a light, but I don't want a backlit reading experience.As to kindle in general, over books: I love having a kindle and never want to go back.  It reads better than a book because I can adjust the text size.  I don't have to deal with the ink rubbing off like with mass market paperbacks, or having stiff binding or accidentally ripping a page or getting water on it.  It's not waterproof but a couple drops here or there are fine as long as they don't get inside the housing.  I don't have to worry about storing the books I want to reread and having to box them up whenever I move.  I don't have to worry about packing enough books for a vacation and the amount of space they will take up in my suitcase.  Lending books is an issue.  There is some way of lending books electronically, but normally the ones I actually want to lend don't have that option.  Browsing for books is also more frustrating.  Going to a bookstore I can at least verify that an editor has corrected the book for grammar, proofreading and quality, where as in the kindle store that is never guaranteed and you can't always tell from the price."
"445","I did get the kindle with special offers. They honestly do not bother me at all. You don't see anything while reading, only the screen saver. And I'm not upset about it recommending a book or something I might enjoy. I've only charged it once since I got it, used it straight out of the box. I never thought I would be an ereader owner but here I am!"
"446","Terrible.  The pages turn with the slightest touch and then it is difficult to go back and find where you were.  It is difficult to bring up the top menu and previous book listings.  You don't know how far in the book you are.  I loved the original Kindle with the forward and back pages, along with the keyboard.  You could also play games with the original.  They really need to devise the original style with the paper white light up version. That I would buy 10 times over."
"447","POOR POST SALES SERVICE , DONT BUY ,NO SUPPORT AFTER WARRANTY PERIOD"
"448","Easy on eyes( had surgery)/ light weight... Enjoyable. Perfect gift"
"449","I have a hard time getting used to the touch screen, the previous 5th gen kindle had a more positive feel for the control buttons. After a week am still unable to to find a way to delete books from the kindle. WHERE IS THE MENU BUTTON? I bought the kindle for reading books, not for all the built in fancy tricks!"
"450","I really like this for reading out in the sun, but wish it had a brighter light at times.  Also wish the letters were a little more sharp.  At Best Buy they didn't have any on display so was sort of left to guessing what differences it might have compared to the next model up.Love the size and have figured out how easy it is to down load and transfer books from old tablet."
"451","Amazon didn't tell me there was no backlight to read in dim rooms"
"452","Not happy with the product. Like the iOS app better for reading."
"453","I only gave 4 stars, because it is about meeting expectations.  I was thinking I could read crochet books and such on the Kindle, but it really isn't great for detailed drawings.  It isn't a fault of the Kindle, just something I hadn't thought to consider.  It is only a 6"" screen, so there is only so much space available.  I do enjoy reading books on it, and that is really what I bought it for.  It is comfortable to hold, more comfortable than an actual book, especially when my kitty is sitting on my lap.  It is also better than an actual book in that you can adjust the font size; that comes in handy in a low-light situation.  I like that I can borrow books at my local library for the Kindle without even going there.  There is also a large selection of free and public domain titles to download without charge on Amazon.  I will finally read a lot of the classics I missed.  The battery seems to last a long time.  I only recharged it so far because I plugged it in to check on books to download.  I just wish it came with a good, protective cover, I will have to buy one or make one.  I am a little afraid to take it with me anywhere without one."
"454","This Kindle allowed me to get back my Paperwhite after daughter made off with it to read Heroes of Olympus series books.  With my Kindle, the next volume was readily available so she could keep going without signing up for the waiting list at her library or making a trip to the bookstore.This model is inexpensive and sturdy enough to be appropriate for an older, elementary age kid.  I'm not following her around, taking it away from her while she tries to keep reading through eating and brushing her teeth.The price point allowed a family member to give this as a holiday gift, allowing me to receive my paperwhite (back again) for a second holiday season in a row!  Everyone is happy now.  Daughter is really not interested in the device in any way, only the books on it.  I suggest setting up an account for the recipient, setting up the device, and loading them up with books you know they want ahead of time unless they are fully comfortable doing this on their own.  We did this and carefully returned the Kindle to the original box.  It's really nice for the recipient to turn it on and go, growing comfortable with the Kindle as they use it.The limitations are that this model isn't for reading in the dark (probably just as well) and doesn't seem to have the family sharing feature although you can share if the other Kindle involved does allow that.  The sharing is fairly confusing still, they have work to do there, but it's OK.  The case parts and form factor are not as nice as more expensive models but this is a reasonable trade off for the price.Hate the Facebook Good Reads feature built in.  Dear Amazon, please remove that as part of your OS and make it an optional feature for those who want it.  Super annoying bloatware, not interested.  I recommend keeping junk from other businesses off your clean and simple device.  Yuck."
"455","I like my new Kindle very much.  I have had the Kindle keyboard for years now and it was starting to get a little wonky now and then.  I have to restart it a couple times a month when it freezes.  I had put this new Kindle on my wish list ""in case"".  I received a price drop notice and jumped on it.  It is much lighter than the keyboard Kindle and that is a big plus.  Also,  the touch screen is sooo much easier than the keyboard.  It takes some getting used to for page turning, but it's not a big deal.  It is very sensitive to touch, but once you get the hang of it, I think it is fine.  I prefer to read on this type of e-reader as it is so much easier on my eyes.  I also have a Fire but do not like to read books on it."
"456","A fantastic little e-reader.  no glare, no hassles, easy to use easy to read.  What more can you ask for in a simple low cost e-reader?  I do not know.  I, like many of you, have an iPhone and an iPad and I love them, and use them every day, but the simple ease of use and easiness on the eyes Kindle is more pleasant to read, and it is so much like reading a paper back book.  Thank you Amazon for this excellent product... now I have over 900 books on my little Kindle."
"457","This is my first Kindle, I found the user interface quite intuitive.  When I read the reviews, so many people said they could not figure it out.  For the life of me, this thing is so simple to use, within 15 minutes, I had it figured out and 10 books loaded on it.  One other common complaint were adds...There are two versions of the machine, one with adds that is cheaper and one without.  If you buy the cheaper version, you are paying a lower price because of the adds.  If you don't want adds, pay the higher price.  Please indulge me on one  final rant, this devise does not have a back light.  That means you need to read it in a lit room or space.  The advantage of this it that it is easy to read outside in sunlight.  If you order one without a back light and complain that you can't read it in the dark....What's a matter wit you???!!!  Read the product description, that is what they are there for.  Not on with my review.  It works.  I can read books on it.  It is easy to use.  .I can read in the bright sun with it and I can't read it in the dark.  This is a good simple devise that does it's job. 'nough.said!"
"458","In the Box: The Kindle box included the Kindle and a USB cord. It would be nice if they included a wall adapter, but no one does these days. Sigh...Size/weight: It has a decent size display at 6"" and the weight is nice, not too heavy.Feel: I like the feel of the Nook Simple Touch better. Its has a soft and smooth rubber type backing that is easy to hold.The the Kindle is just plastic. This is bad. It slips through my fingers easily and if I am holding it for a long time my fingers sweat (making it more likely I will drop it on my face while laying in bed lol). They seriously need to fix this.Touch Screen: Works great, with a fast response time.Adding books: With the Kindle, if you don't purchase the book from Amazon you can simply email your book to your kindle email address and it's added to your device over wifi. ""WHAT"" you say? YES it's that easy. Man I have been missing out.Deleting Books: You can simply hold and touch the book icon on your Kindle until a screen pops up and select remove from device. Your book is still on your Amazon account and you can re-send it at anytime.Battery Life: You know this one is hard for me to gauge because I really don't pay attention and I read a lot. I started using my Kindle on December 4th and have not been notified to charge it yet so, that is a plus (I have had wifi on the whole time, the charge is getting pretty low though).Other: The Kindle's lack of page numbers is really annoying. I like having the ability to glance down and seeing how far into a book I am. The Kindle does not allow this. HUGE bummer. The Kindle allows you to highlight passages and makes notes. It's a nice feature to have and I have already used it. The Kindle has some quirk I have yet to figure out. When I drop it on my head while reading (yes this does happen often as like I said above, its slippery plastic shell is not cool) or hits something on accident when I set it down, it changes the font size. Kinda annoying. Anyone know if I can turn off what ever feature is causing this? I purchased mine on Black Friday for only $49 with ads. The ads are perfectly fine on there. I am glad i didn't pay more to not have them. I"
"459","I started with one of the keyboard 3G kindles, then moved up to a first gen Kindle Fire. I loved both of them. The screen on the keyboard one cracked, so I had to take the fire around with me. It's quite heavy and I had been thinking about getting a regular kindle for the train commute, so I didn't have to carry the fire around. When I saw this one on sale for $49, I took the plunge.Things I don't like about it - the touch screen does seem to be kind of hyper sensitive. Many times, I've touched to change pages and it's jumped ahead several pages. Also, the unit just froze a few times within the first few days of use, and I had to hold the power button in to get it to shut down and then restart it. Upon restarting, it put me back a few chapters. It is hard to see details on the pictures of book covers as you are browsing. The picture is not sharp or focused. I have taken to buying the books on my laptop and loading them onto it because it's useless for browsing. I won't send it back because, for the most part, it serves the purpose for which it was purchased, glitches aside. However, I would not want to have this as my only device to purchase and read books on.The screen is kind of small. Smaller than the keyboard one was. I'm counting that as a neutral point because, although it's annoying to have to change pages more often, it does contribute to the overall compactness of this e-reader. The screen is also dull, which I don't consider a bad thing but you might. I find the lack of back lighting easy on my eyes, however, you can't read it in dim lighting.Things I like about it - It's very light. Probably a quarter of the weight of my Fire. It also starts up instantly. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles, which I like. I bought it so I could read books on the train and it covers that without a bunch of other stuff that could go wrong with it. I like the ability to adjust the font size (you can do this on all Kindles).Overall, I'm satisfied with it for the price. I would be less happy if I had paid the full price for it. For under $50, it was worth it."
"460","This is my 4th Kindle and my least favorite.  It looks and feels cheap.  However, for the price I wasn't expecting a lot, thus 4 stars.  If you expect it to perform like it only cost $79, you'll be happy.  If you buy this version expecting the touch screen to perform like your cell phone or tablet you'll be disappointed.  I found that tapping the screen works better than swiping to turn the page.  If I used my Kindle daily I would want a nicer version.  For reading a couple of days a week this is a great deal.Pros:  It is cheap (I bought it on sale for $59).  It is small and light so it fits easily in my purse.  I like the touch screen well enough, it is fairly responsive for such an inexpensive electronic device.  It is comfortable to hold while reading, a little easier than my Kindle Keyboard because it is lighter and there aren't any buttons to accidentally press while reading.  The screen is fairly responsive when highlighting a word to look up in the dictionary.Cons: This Kindle does not have holes in the side to pop in to a cover; I like that feature in my previous Kindle Keyboard.  I haven't purchased the cover that is made for it so I can't speak to how well it is designed.  There are no page turn buttons.  Some people might not care, some may.  I thought the screen images would be sharper based on the product description.  Book covers and books with pictures are decent but not as crisp as my Kindle Keyboard.Overall I'd recommend this version to someone looking for a cheap, casual use eReader.  If you are a heavy user or picky about the performance of your electronics I'd upgrade to a different version."
"461","Bought this for my mother. She's older and isn't the biggest fan of electronics, a let alone touchscreen devices, but she loves this. One thing to be aware of, however, is that comes pre-loaded with the account from which it's ordered. If it's being given as a gift, you'll want to make sure to correct this."
"462","Didn't expect it to be so hard on my eyes.  Would prefer a backlight."
"463","i was some what disappointed that the screen was not bright enough. i was used to the kindle fire and i assumed that the screen on the kindle was as bright."
"464","I must have ordered the wrong cover It does not fitThe cover won't close."
"465","I have to say, I like this thing, but it would be better- so much so, with more settings, and an ability to turn off the ads that display themselves on it.Namely, it'd be nice to put some books behind a password, to set a cover image for the kindle itself when idle, and to import fonts. At this point it is and will seem to stay something I got for what it was worth when it was on sale earlier this year. (2015)I mean, it's nice. As far as using it though, it can be frustrating for someone with big hands and flat-tipped fingers. Namely, most commands seem to be set up for either a device 1.5 times the size, or for manipulation using only the nail of your finger, if that's even possible. Buttons don't seem to follow the basic logic of finger size in any way. Text links in the browser for instance have no isolation from eachother. Poke one and you may just poke the one near it, or above, even below, or perhaps you'll zoom out instead. I mean, again... I'm glad I got it for what I did. Glad I have it, yeah, but not as glad as I could be."
"466","My first kindle was the kindle keyboard so my review is in comparison to that. I didn't update until now due to device storage. The other kindles between keyboard and this one were half the storage so no way was I going to do a backwards step. Overall, I really do like this kindle. It is easy to use. I love the anti glare and how the pages look like that of a real book in that off white colour.There are only 2 points in which I don't like about this kindle.1: Collections names with number of items in them take up 2 lines instead of 1, resulting in less number of collections showing on the one screen. There is plenty of room for the name of the collection and for the number of items in each collection to be side by side. By doing this, more collections could be listed per screen/page. In this instance, I prefer the following: Fiction (10) or Fiction - 10. The word item/s after the number is totally optional.2: When viewing All, collections are no longer at the top with all books listed below them. Even then, with the keyboard, the only items showing after the collections were those not place in a collection. Now, whether they are in a collection or not, all are showing. In this instance, I prefer the way it was with my kindle keyboard: Collections at the top, everything else underneath them and any added to collections not show up in the All listing. The reason for this is because I would only place them into a collection after I had read them. If they weren't in a collection then I had not read them. It just made it so much easier to work out what I had and hadn't read. Now, I am wasting time by having to check on goodreads as to whether I've read the book or not.Other than those two points, I am happy with this device."
"467","Excellent. This is my first reading Kindle and I am not disappointed! Works exactly as described. I have had this for six days and have used about 50% of battery. I have been turning on wi-fi for a few minutes a couple times a day. I have also been reading for one to two hours a day. Happy with battery life."
"468","So far so good. It is as described. No back light, but the screen looks like a real book which is amazing for technology. I've never had a kindle before, but so far I'm loving it. But one suggestion: before buying this, read the page so you won't be like others complaining about what it is 'missing' when it says it doesn't have it."
"469","I liked the older model better. If you pick up this kindle, or touch a word by mistake it changes pages, or activates other features. I like to sometimes Mark my place for a moment with my finger, or follow the print with my finger. This will not work with this model. I understand progress, but to eliminate the older non touch screen completely was a mistake on the part of Kindle"
"470","I have now had three Kindles. The first one, unfortunately, had problems before I used it. Amazon replaced it immediately and I grew quite fond of it. I was very comfortable with software system. But,alas, the second one died totally unexpected. It wasn't a dead battery. It just simply would not turn on and it,s light was dead. So I ordered a new one. The operating software has been upgraded and I,m not all that pleased with the OS. It used to be that I could call on the dictionaries at any time and look up a word from any other book. The new, third, Kindle does not allow me to do that. Other than that all else is okay. It is some what lighter than the metal cased ones and sometimes the screen freezes up on it and it takes several swipes to get it to respond to a simple page turn. So the OS system is why I gave it a four star rating."
"471","This is a lightweight Kindle that is really lightweight, I have purchased Kindles and love the screen because I can read outside without glare which I didn't find in the Fire.  This is fantastic for people who love to read on the go and can read anywhere.  I carry it in my bag with me everywhere!!"
"472","I thought my first Kindle was broke so I purchased another one and after I received it my first one started working again so I go back and forth between them.  I love using my Kindles. I don't think I will ever go back to real books.  If you love to read like I do you can't go wrong with a Kindle e-reader."
"473","My kindle does not have a backlight. Why? No more electronics purchases from amazon!"
"474","I did not realize it was only 6"" and not in color.I am very disappointed."
"475","It doesn't light up as the ad had stated.  The rebate was denied and I did it on the website so I played 30.00 more because of that.  I would not purchase again"
"476","Only problem I had with it was 2 days after I ordered mine, Amazon dropped the pricetag $20!!!"
"477","I did not receive any instruction on how to use it; I have yet to get any text to read. HELP!"
"478","I am unhappy because it would be as easy to read as my paprewhite- and it definitely is not. My paperwhite was damaged by water, so I ordered this by mistake, and I am very unhappy"
"479","Help  The screen is to dark for me to read and I can't find a  way  to  make it lighter."
"480","I've had my Kindle for a few days now, since the release date, so 5 days total, and so far I absolutely love it. I was skeptical of the touchscreen, but I find that I actually like it much more than the previous Kindle. It has a ""swipe-to-open"" feature to unlock the device, in addition to the button on the bottom of the device.It's not bad, but I feel it's a bit redundant when there's a button to unlock the device as well. It also has parental controls which is a nice touch for those who have kids that like to go purchasing things with 1-click. The set-up is just like the previous generation Kindle Paperwhite, which is very clean and well organized in my personal opinion.The casing feels a bit cheap, it doesn't have the smooth back like the previous generation Kindle did, which I was a fan of. Other than the casing I love the device and would recommend it to anyone looking into an e-reader. I would suggest a clip-on light to go along with it if you're one who likes to read in bed, but don't want to spend the extra money for a built-in light."
"481","I've had this a few weeks now.  Only had charge it once so far, the batteryLasts. The kindle unlimited is just fantastic (free for the first 30 days and I'm hooked now) So many selections!  My nook had kicked the bucket after about 5 years or so, and I'm so glad I switched to kindle. I do so much on Amazon and the points add up on the credit card which can helped pay for this kindle device. My son can use it and read anytime he wants although he's not really a big reader, there are enough selections of books on minecraft that he's actually reading without me having to pester him to do so.  the device itself handles well, I like the cover that was in the bundle, and it's fairly easy to maneuver in. It's much faster thank my nook was as well, which kept dropping the wireless but this kindle does not have that issue."
"482","I like it much better than my first generation kindle. The size is perfect. Not too big, not too small. I like the touch screen. It's light weight and the flash when the page changes is much shorter than the first gen."
"483","This product has not been delivered to my house I checked and no one has seen this package at all."
"484","This works well and my granddaughter loves it.  However I have a kindle fire from when they were first released that has never worked correctly for nother  granddaughter.  How can I get hellp?"
"485","Just okay....it takes some getting used to.  Lots of things are different from my older Kindle."
"486","With out a back light feature you must be in a well lit area to read it. I will be retuning it."
"487","You need exterior lighting to read this kindle so you can't read if others want the lights out ect.  Wish I had the kindle that was stolen from me.  I could read that anytime day or night."
"488","These Kindles are garbage. This is the second one I've owned and has died and is now worthless. The warranty is only one year for a reason--it will die literally right after the one year mark. Shame on you Amazon for making such garbage."
"489","My daughter loves this kindle.  She loves the touchscreen and how when you turn it off and turn it back on it remembers where you were on your book.  I like how it has parental controls so I can block the browser and wifi on it.  I would not have purchased it if I wasn't able to block these things. The only thing I would change is one thing.  She forgot her password and could not open the kindle.  So, I researched online how to open it and quickly found a code that would reset it.  This worked (although it reset it back to factory settings) and she was able to use it again.  But now the parental controls are off of it.  If the child knows the wifi password they can get on the browser easily.  So,  I feel that amazon should somehow change that part where anyone can look up the code online to open the kindle if  it is locked.  Maybe they could make the parent contact them through their email and they send us a password that way.  This part would only bother you if you are a parent who likes to monitor internet usage like me.  Other than that  (which may not bother some people) ... I love the kindle!  It is great!!!!  I would recommend it to others!"
"490","Returned kindle that included case with the price.Only received refund for kindle and not case."
"491","this was supposed to  be back lit and it not.  we will be calling for a return.  feel we were misled"
"492","I owned a kindle but the screen got damaged for no reason. I contacted Amazon and they told me that it happens some times.. Anyway I loved my kindle so I wanted a new one. The person I talked with persuaded me to buy this version as it was with a great $20 discount. This was no more than two weeks ago. And now I check the deals and the kindle price dropped another $10.. Not sure if Amazon can do anything about this. But surely is not nice to pay a higher price for the same item not even a month ago."
"493","I bought this for my wife, and she doesn't have the vision problems that I have, and even she has a hard time reading the screen on this Kindle, as it is way too dim. I can barely read it at all. I have found there is no way to increase the brightness ( I have been told by Amazon that there is no way to do so ). My wife said she'd just put up with the problem, as it was a gift from me.This Kindle Reader is not disabled friendly, or accessible to those that have any sort of vision problems, or problems with their hands. I am disappointed. I would not buy this for myself. I was told by Amazon that I can just spend more, to get a better reader, or tablet."
"494","I hate this more than any other of my Kindles, and I have had many, many Kindles.This one is so buggy that it makes me incredibly frustrated. For example, it is constantly transforming the font size because of accidentally activating font-size-change. (Why? Who changes font size? Maniacs?).The forward backward is a ruthles, angry tap, not a simple click...It is thick and heavier than any previous edition.It cut my husband's head open when he somehow managed to bump it.The functionality is so beta-mode that I am sad, sad, sad that my nice little kindle committed suicide the other week."
"495","This kindle is so easy to use.  Really light in weight.  I love you can use it outside in the bright sun.  A tablet you can't see the words but on this kindle you can.  Just like a book.  This would make a perfect christmas gift."
"496","I find I do not have enough info. to understand how to use it.  I sure like like my old Kindle much better."
"497","gift"
"498","Nice"
"499","Received a Kindle Paperwhite for a gift and can't figure out what the heck I would want one for.  Sorry."
"500","I liked my old, broken one better, but this is almost as good. My only drawback is that when I divide my books up into categories, they are still all out there instead of neatly tucked away until I open the proper category. I mean, with 130 books and counting, that's a lot of books to flick through."
"501","This is my sixth kindle, actually it is for my daughter.  I can see it is improved in many ways than even the first generation of paper white.  The touch screen is smooth and sensitive. I like it and hope my daughter will read a lot on it."
"502","I love my Wi-Fi Kindle.  The ads show when I first open my Kindle, but after that I never see them.  Talk about hassle-free and unobtrusive.  In fact, let me tell you how convenient this device is.I lived overseas in a non-English speaking country.  A few bookstores had full-priced books in Eng.  Our group of ESL teachers would pass our books along to one another or wait all year for the used book fair.  Then I bought my Kindle during a trip back to the US.  I learned I could log into my local library back in the US via my laptop or my smartphone.  I would then check out an e-book.  I turned on my Kindle and activated the Wi-Fi. In 15 seconds my new library book was downloaded.  I easily saved the $79 cost of my Kindle while downloading library books while 7,500 miles from home.  Try reading one of these Kindles on a sunny day:  NO glare.  I love it!"
"503","I love to read in bed at night, and did not realize it did not have a lighted background. so it is not what I needed."
"504","Love the feel of paperback books. Couldn't get used to having an electronic for reading novels. Had to send it back."
"505","The ads are really distracting and stupid. I keep my screen turned off when not reading so I don't have to see them."
"506","gave this as a gift, should have spent the extra and got the fire, this one is smaller and a little harder to read."
"507","I saw wi-fi and thought the kids could use it for homework games. Nope. I have no need for a glorified book cover."
"508","So far this has been what I expected.  The ads don't bother me.  I like getting classic books from Project Gutenberg.  It's not as fancy as an IPAD, and I have an IPAD.  But I prefer to read books on a Kindle so I don't clutter up the cloud."
"509","I was very unhappy with this Kindle from the moment I got it charged up.  There was not enough contrast to be able to read the titles of books.  Even the special offers looked very dim. I contacted customer support and asked repeatedly if this was a defect for this particular Kindle, but the lady I spoke with said they are all that way.  My old Kindle is much easier to read than this new technology and that doesn't make any sense to me.  To add insult to injury, she said I wouldn't have to pay to send it back but I still got charged for the return shipping."
"510","After reading reviews for this product I decided it was the best for me. I just needed a way to read my books on the go and didn't need any of the fancy features the newer kindles have. The lack of a backlight hasn't been an issue and neither has the power button being on the bottom-in fact I like it better this way. I also decided not to buy the power adapter because it came with a power cord that plugs into either my laptop or iPhone charger adapter using the USB port. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for new, lower priced books at your fingertips"
"511","The e-reader was not what I expected.  The size was ok, but there was no color, and the functions were not easily understandable.."
"512","It is hard for me to operate the may functions provided by the Kindle.  I read the guide and it is long and hard to follow."
"513","I wish this kindle had backlight. I'm have major trouble finding the correct lighted case for this Kindle online. I'll have to take it into the store."
"514","I bought this for my daughter... I now use it for myself! I have a few kids books on it, but she likes the color pictures. Im always amazed at the selection of books available, wish they weren't so expensive though. Some books its actually been more expensive as an ebook!"
"515","I would like for this device to not only store books, but a library of editorials, short stories, academic research articles, and notable essays."
"516","This is a great Kindle. I used to have the Kindle keyboard. It is much easier to maneuver around when you can touch the screen as opposed to having to press buttons to control everything. It was smartly designed. The battery also lasts longer, as long as you leave it in airplane mode. I also discovered Goodreads through using this Kindle, which is sort of built-in. It's a great site and app to help you organize the books you've read, want to read, and to get suggestions for books from friends' reviews. Back to the Kindle, it is great. You have to treat it like a paper book and make sure you have enough light (none are built-in, but there are clip-on light accessories you can buy). Since the screen is glare-free, as advertised, you can read outside in bright sunlight. I took this to the beach with me and it was great. Highly recommended."
"517","Display screen is frozen and I cannot access  the ""library"" or anything else.  Battery is fully charged.  What is my next step??????"
"518","I have never bought any kind of electrical device that did not include the power adaptor. Seriously? You have to buy a separate power adaptor for $15.00 to make this flimsy piece of plastic work."
"519","Product is not user friendly. I intend to return the item because I was unable to obtain any reading material,and could,not see the screen.Very disappointing."
"520","Love my new Kindle, I bought the Fire HD tablet before buying an eReader and I always get distracted and start playing games or wanting to watch a video  with this I get to just read my books with out being tempted to do something else. Plus I love when I have to read long documents for work I can email them straight to my Kindle and read then any where at home, out side, or even bring it up during my meetings and I don't have to hassle with a bunch of paperwork it's all at my finger tips."
"521","This is a nifty little Kindle that perfectly fulfills the need for which I bought it.  I have a Kindle Fire, but in preparing for a trip to Australia and New Zealand, I wanted a portable e-reader that was lighter weight and had a longer battery life than my Fire.  I also wanted to be able to read it in the sunlight.  Can't do that with the Fire.  A Paperwhite might also have been an option, but it is pricier than this Kindle.  It's true this Kindle doesn't have a backlight, but then neither do regular books!  I haven't found this to be a problem at all.  Before e-readers, we always had to have an outside light source to read a book, and we didn't give it a second thought.  This little Kindle still has multiple options that are the same as my Fire -- such as wi-fi and the built-in dictionary that lets me look up the meaning of a word instantly.  All in all, I love it!  Very light weight -- less than a paperback -- extremely long battery life, especially in Airplane mode -- and many options for changing the font style and size.  I'm looking forward to carrying it with me on my trip -- so portable, convenient, and readable! Also, because of the price break,I got the version with the ads -- they are very unobtrusive, only the screen saver and not bothersome at all!"
"522","I would like to return it and purchase another.. It's not what i thought it was.. Haven't use it..  Just wanna purchase something else maybe kindle fire .."
"523","Great way to read your books on the go. The display never hurts your eyes, your reading experience is fully customizable and thanks to the 4 GB internal storage you probably won't need external storage devices. Adding books from amazon is extremely simple and books from other sources can also be easily uploaded, provided the format is correct. The device does not accept EPUB so make sure your books are saved as PDF. What really helped me immerse myself in the reading experience was the vocabulary builder. All words you search in the dictionary are store and every now and then you can pop over to see how many words you remember. Searching a word in the dictionary is also easy, just tap it. Setup is quick, weight feels just right and the home menu has the perfect design."
"524","The cheapie with center toggle and side button page turns is still the best. It allows for excellent collection making and errors are few because you don't arrive somewhere unexpected because of butterfingers. This one is not bad, but it is heavier and not my favorite. Simple, cheap, idiot proof and intuitively organizable is my way."
"525","When I first received my kindle, I was skeptical of whether or not this reading experience would be more enjoyable than holding a physical book. I often view books as friends, and I believed that like friends, experiences with them in person are more rewarding than through electronic communication. However, this device proved me wrong! I love having access to all of my books in the palm of my hand, being able to easily search particular parts of the book (this is most helpful when writing papers and needing to access quick notes!), as well as having access to an instant dictionary. I highly recommend checking out Kindle, if you've never had one before. This is particularly useful for travelers, students, and avid readers. The only other device I use more often than my kindle is my cell phone!"
"526","I had been avoiding getting an eReader for so long because I love books. But I finally decided it was time because I can't fit all my books anymore. This is a wonderful invention. I absolutely love the convenience and ease, and the reader itself is very comfortable. I regret not spending a little extra for the built in light."
"527","This was a gift for my parents.  Very easy to use and they love it.  Fits in a purse and is the same size as a paperback book.  They travel quite a bit and are always reading.  Amazon carries every book they use (Masonic lodge and Eastern Star books)  They love that they are not carrying an arm load of books :) The only down is they fight over who gets to use it :)  My parents are in their 80's-touch screen makes it perfect for them.  Very easy to use and they also love the fact that they can change the type size.I've owned kindles from the first gen, I currently own a fire, however for just reading this is perfect."
"528","I was not impressed with this product. The screen is gray, not white. The text seems very pixelated no matter the font or size I set it at. The screen is far too dark as well."
"529","Not the same as my original one. No backlight can't see what I'm reading. I should return it. If your looking at this don't buy it. Not the same quality as the original one."
"530","I am too overwhelmed... Can't find what I am looking for... Lost all my books on the Kindle that broke, anddidn't even read the last books I purchased when it broke."
"531","I'm disappointed this reader is smaller than the original and has no side openings for cover clips. Therefore, it doesn't fit into my two very nice leather Kindle covers."
"532","I did not know this product did not come with a reading (backlight) feature. Yes, I should read the specifications but given this is the latest model it should have, at minimum, existing features of earlier models."
"533","I purchased this Kindle for my bf after his old one froze up. He loves it. The screen is very sharp and clear. It's also easy to hold. It seems a bit thicker than his last one but he hasn't complained about it. It's also easy to navigate. I love the fact that you can save words that you've looked up through the dictionary."
"534","I am disappointed. I owned a Kindle before this that I had a lot of books on and games. I called before I ordered to make sure these items would be on my new one. I was told they would be. They are not. [ Or I cannot find them. It is not what I thought it would be. I am returning it."
"535","I was disappointed it did not have a backlight.  I still can't figure out why the pages skip sometimes but overall I like the experience, especially the dictionary and highlight feature."
"536","After using a Kindle Fire for nearly a year, this was an adjustment.  But the device works wonderfully and is easy to use.  With no light I am limited on the times I use it. It will serve it's purpose tho and that is to feed my constant need to read."
"537","I am still figuring out this Kindle, much more difficult to use than the previous one.  That one worked fine until it just died.  With this one, I am never sure how to find what I want."
"538","I had an older Kindle for many years, it was wonderful. Last January, while on vacation, I tripped and it went into the deep end of the pool. So I replaced it with this the current Kindle. I am so sorry to say that the touch screen technology is unreliable. The reason to have a kindle, opposed to simply using your tablet, is how easy it is to read in full sun. However the new touch screen does not function once it heats up in the sun. So what's the point? If you want to read by the pool, buy a paperback.  I hope Amazon will return to the reliable technology of the older version soon. Until then do not waste your money on this terrible item."
"539","I cannot get the screen to lighten - I much preferred my old one which had the light that you could change for light and dark rooms. The screen is too dark and very difficult to read."
"540","No backlight... at all ! So dark you just can't see it. After several hours on the phone to tech, they confirmed there was no adjustment to backlight, because there was no backlight."
"541","DID NOT LIKE THIS KINDLE ITS SO SMALL!!!  HAVE A HARD TIME USE TO IT SO QUIT USING !!!  THANK GOODNESS I FOUND MY FIRE KINDLE THAT IS WHAT I WILL BE USING FROM NOW OWN,  THANK YOU"
"542","I already own a Kindle Fire and had gotten tired of trying to be able to read while in direct sunlight.  I use my Kindle Fire mostly to watch videos on long trips or at the gym as well as read and as long as I was not in direct sunlight there was no glare off the screen.  I was looking for a reading kindle and a good deal popped up and I was able to purchase this one for $50.  I love it, perfect for exactly what I was looking for, reading books either purchased or borrowed through Amazon lending library and Prime.  I was finally able to sit outside by the pool or at the beach and read my Kindle.  This device is perfectly simple for anyone wanting a reading device WITHOUT a light, it tells you it doesn't come with a light so don't buy it and then give a bad review b/c it doesn't come with a light, there's a model up from this one that comes with a light."
"543","It does work as advertised but the electric discharge is rediculous. My eyes blur out when I hold the kindle and my whole body can feel the electricity. Can someone tell me what to do about this?"
"544","Other than it came a few days late when I ordered guaranteed 2 day shipping it was pretty good. But I do find it pretty lousy when a package is guaranteed to arrive in two days and it doesn't"
"545","only ok"
"546","I love this kindle.  It is my third one and  read with it more than the other two because the battery lasts such a long tie and I can see the print when I'm outside.  It was also a lot cheaper than my first two kindles."
"547","instructions very hard to follow, and we had to download instructions from on line, Seems like it is very hard to use.  Do not like it, but have already gotten rid of the packaging so can not return.  Too bad."
"548","This is my second Kindle and I do not like it as much as I do my first one.  It is frustrating to use, does not have as much flexibility for settings and organization as my first Kindle.  The thing I dislike the most about this Kindle is that when I have wireless turned off, it will turn back on by itself.  I do not like objects that override my instructions without my permission.  It also does not allow you to monitor downloads as my first Kindle does.  In the couple of months I have had it, it has reset itself more times than my original Kindle has in all the years I have owned it.  I can't imagine what Amazon was thinking when they designed the software for this, but whatever it was, they need to go back to the drawing board."
"549","I love how this has changed my life.  I'd pretty much given up reading - had an accident that lost most of my vision and reading is about impossible even with large print and magnifying devices.  My daughters though that with the ability to increase the font size on here I just might be able to read books again, so they got it for me for my Birthday - BEST GIFT EVER!  I can see!  I've already read one book in a week that would have taken me 6 months or more to read with large print and a magnifying device!  I'm on my 2nd book now!  I just wish the dictionary would have as large of print as the page does - very hard for me to see the results, even with a magnifying device, but I'm reading easily and enjoying it again after 8 years of not being able to"
"550","I'm really enjoying the experience since I switched from physical books to the Kindle. Many peoples main argument is they don't like reading from a screen, and I totally agree. While the majority of my time is spent on my phone or computer reading various things, the long form of books becomes wearisome for my eyes after extended periods. The e-ink technology definitely replicates the look and feeling of reading a book, without the hassle of trying to carry a library with you.This is perfect for someone who loves to read and travels a lot. The ease and convienience of having your own personal library in such a small form factor, with a battery that lasts as long as the kindle does, is really a lifestyle changing experience."
"551","This kindle is pretty good. I am just starting to use it, and I find some of the touchscreen sensitivity annoying, and there aren't as many straightforward options as I'd like - for example, on the home screen, I can't swipe/tap to see the next page, but tap on the page number and type in 2. Annoying. Maybe I just haven't figured it out yet!Reading is really nice on this, again, except the sensitivity of the touchscreen. I often find myself accidentally turning pages when I shift position, then I have to figure out how many I moved forward, etc. Otherwise, I really don't miss having an actual book to flip through. For travelers, I think a kindle makes a lot of sense, and that's the primary reason I got this one."
"552","Love it."
"553","Unable to use device; can/t down load anything.  Need written instructions, much too much info on screen to wade thru.  Books offered are not things I normally read.  So could I return it for credit?"
"554","I bought this Kindle because my old one run over by a car. Although I love to read, the main thing I wanted was to play the free word games offered by Kindle. When I received it, I discovered I could only play games on the more expensive models."
"555","Like it a lotNoticed that during a storm when my power went out I was going to read but ""no light"" meant the kindle didn't workWas all set to spend the ""downtime"" reading"
"556","it was a gift, do not like, cant see the letters because of dark background, I would have been happy with something that did more than just read, don't think I will use, but the thought was there!"
"557","I was really happy to get this device because I needed a small reader with lots of references however I cannot adjust the screen brightness and this is inconvenient sometimes because you're supposed to be able to read in the dark as well as the light.  I do not find this true in either case and maybe you can tell me how to adjust it it's nice to have all my books with me that I need to read and research so that is a definite pro plus.  I think I also thought it was in color but that's not a problem.  I did notice however that it doesn't have a speakers and that is one of the pluses for the article. Until I got this I have been taking my iPad with me and it was good to and of course I could adjust the screen but then you get the advertisements when you're might not want them or something jumps and when you're trying to read that you might not want but I think you might need all in all a nice reader and I enjoy having it with me and easy to carry.  In fact I think I might take it to church with me soon once I get my Bibles and references loaded.  All in all a nice little device just not worthy of five stars I don't think"
"558","I'm much happier with this Kindle than I expected to be.  However I miss the automatic downloads of my NYTimes subscription that I had with my old kindle just from being online.  Now it is a multiple-step process (go online, select download from the cloud).  Maybe there is a way to fix this but I haven't figured it out yet."
"559","Takes some getting used to, from my old kindle. I love the smaller size and the fact that I don't have to push a button to turn the page, and since I already had a light that actually fits perfectly onto the edge, I can see to read at night, without a bedside lamp on. Love it, although I wish it had been easier to transfer content from my old one to this one. And wish it stayed charged longer. Although it hold a charge longer than my Kindle Fire does. Will need to upgrade that one soon!"
"560","Bought a kindle e-reader Christmas 2011, it is dead in April 2015 considering what paid for it it is not worth the price. Kindle customer service could not help, I have had phones and computers last longer than this. When I tried to get help the end result was to offer me expensive replacements."
"561","can not load books"
"562","Love it."
"563","Since I am such a big kindle fan when I saw this one I thought it would make a great gift for someone in the family. I love the fact that I can take my entire library with me anywhere I go without breaking my back carrying all those books. This kindle is easy to use and the glare free screen makes it easy to read outside or in bright light. The screen is clear and whether it is a pdf file or a kindle book it is easy to navigate through the book. Overall I think this is a nice basic kindle for someone who doesn't need all the bells and whistles that come with the fire editions."
"564","I'm happy with it so far.  The battery lasts long, it isn't glitchy (I had a jailbroken Nook 1st Gen for about 3 years - and that is starting to need a reboot every 2 hours of activity).Thanks to Calibre and Send To Kindle, I'm able to get all of my files in the palm of my hand."
"565","I had an older keyboard style Kindle for years and it came up missing.  We looked everywhere for it and figured I'd lost in while traveling.  So I finally decided to pick up this new Kindle.  I really like its size and light weight, and I think the screen has higher contrast and is easier for me to read.  So about a week after receiving it, guess what?  I found the older Kindle in the zippered pocket in a bag, right where I'd put it.  So now I have two.  I have a case for the older one with a light, so I use that at home in bed.  I'll be taking the newer one with me when I travel for its form factor.  I love how all my content is linked together so I can read on my cell phone, computer, or either Kindle.  (PS.... we LOVE our Echo too, Alexa is becoming a member of the family."
"566","I bought this for my daughter, for when we travel. It is horrible. I am quite frankly surprised by the positive reviews. It is so dark, that even with good illumination it hurts your eyes. Is is old looking, the software is horrible, SLOW, DATED, and  OBSOLETE in the looks and and the functionality.  I bought books and tried to upload them on the new kindle, and it would not let me. It looks like a device sold in the eighties. How it is even possible this thing is sold and it has positive reviews, its beyond me. The darkness of the screen is the most upsetting thing. HORRIBLE object and upsetting buy."
"567","No backlight. Returning"
"568","Very good."
"569","It does not have a light to use when it is dark."
"570","This touch Kindle is clunky and heavier. I got it as a gift and it's still in the box. It doesn't have the rubber backing I am used to that makes it easier to hold, especially in bed. It is plasticky all over and looks cheap. I just don't understand the thinking behind its design. I use my Kindle for reading books. Nothing more. I just want it as small and as light as possible."
"571","The Kindle is true to it's product descriptions. As the description and many other reviewers have stated, it has no back-light. That's fine, however, it's still much darker than I feel it ought to be. At very first I thought I was being stupid with my mental complaints, but then I placed my kindle next to a book page and there was a massive difference. The issue is that the kindle background isn't white, it's gray, so there's not a lot of contrast. I suppose that's what makes the Kindle Paperwhite so attractive, though.The other thing that is disappointing about the Kindle is that whenever you turn a page or do anything with it there's a moment of glitches while the page changes. It's almost a split second, but it happens every time. I'd expected it to be a bit smoother than that.Other than those small complaints, I do like my new Kindle. The extra features are really what makes this device a worthwhile purchase.Edit: I received my Kindle just this past Friday. I charged it fully then proceeded to use it. Since then (it's been five days) the battery is halfway down. I don't know if I just read more than other Kindle users (I don't think I do), but the description says that the battery lasts weeks. At the rate it's going, my Kindle will need a recharge in just ten days, which is technically not weeks, it's days. Obviously, that's disappointing to me, and I did dock my review by one star, but it's still a good battery life for a device."
"572","I recently purchased a new glare proof kindle,, and I'm very happy with it. It's super light- weight and the glare proof screen is amazing. The lighter weight is a blessing since the arthritis is becoming worse in my hands and arms. I can hold my new kindle for hours without any pain. Also, I love to read outside and I will be doing a lot of that this summer with my new kindle."
"573","Not a lot to say here that isn't pretty subjective. I wanted a reader that has a good screen (this one is clear and very readable, could have a little better contrast), is light (it's lighter than most books but heavier than I expected), and has good battery life (probably better if I could remember to turn off the WiFi after I download something). I did not want a reader with more features. I could do without the occasional black-white-black flicker when you turn pages, and I don't get the impression that this simple, plastic device is worth a hundred dollars. In its seventh generation, the basic Kindle is good but could be better for the money. IMHO."
"574","This is exactly what I expected from the product description, so I am almost, but not quite, perfectly happy with it. This is a little thing, but while you can put it in landscape mode, it only does it with the fat part of the bezel on the left-hand side. This is really annoying if you want to use your left hand for anything other than holding the Kindle, as might be the case if you are left handed. I can't imagine that it would be that hard to let you flip the display for lefties. One star demerit for dexter chauvinism."
"575","can not read books that i purchased on device and on desktop"
"576","I'm so upset about this device - it's black and white!! No colors at all! As I need colored pictures for the books I use (tutorials and encyclopedias) it's useless without color. It wasn't mentioned anywhere in the description that it's black and white, only on the specifications page if you open it separately which I didn't when I was ordering it. I would never buy it knowing it has no colors. I assumed that in 21 century everything is colored and the books come in their original form. I'm returning it. Very disappointed."
"577","Hard to read"
"578","no backlight"
"579","I love the Kindle device, I really do.  But I'm just not really all that happy with this version.  I prefer the way my old Kindle Touch was made.  I don't like the material it is made out of now.  It shows fingerprints (not on the screen, only on the black part) which drives my OCD crazy.  Also, the inside edge of it where the black surrounding part meets the screen has a dip, which collects dust or hair.  This drives me nuts.  I use my Kindle daily because I love to read so much.  I love the Kindle allows me to do that.  I just love my old one so much more because it didn't have either of these issues.  I find I am constantly picking out hair, bits of fuzz, or teeny crumbs out of the little edge.  What annoys me more is that when I do this I have to make sure I'm not actually reading or I will accidentally turn the page 10 times by touching the screen.  So I just try to blow the little nasties away which isn't very effective.  It's just annoying.  I was so excited to be getting the newer version, and I expected to love it just as much as my old Kindle Touch.  I'm not sure if the Paperwhite is made the same way or not.  If it is, and I had gone ahead and purchased that one like I was considering, I would be REALLY upset."
"580","Dear amazonThank you for you help and for  always answering questions.YOU DO GOOD BUSINESS! I appreciate you taking your customers first.  I love my new Kindle, and have figured it out, and found Network password in my previous notes kept. My old Kindle was so much simpler, and I wasn't prepared for such advancements..Now after my reading, and spending time with it I am delighted, and loving it. Thank you again for being there for your customers...NEZ"
"581","After 4 years my Nook started giving me trouble so I decided to give the Kindle a try.  But mistake!!! I had a hard time reading in a well lit room.  It is way too dark!!!!  Plus it just feels and looks cheap!!  I will stick with the Nook which I believe to be a superior product!!!  The worst part is that I have to pay to send this piece of junk back!!!"
"582","Used to own a keyboard kindle and it finally stopped working. This one is not as comfortable to hold and the screen is definitely not glare-free. I am using the same light to read by as my old kindle but constantly have to adjust the position because of the glare."
"583","A new technology from past Kindles but once I got used to it am very very pleased.Lots of free books from Amazon.com and our local library has a reasonably good collection of books to read in Kindle format."
"584","I love my kindle dearly.  I have resisted buying a kindle for years being a ""Paper Only"" kind of guy but this device is wonderful.  It does a fantastic job of giving wonderful technology helps while making you feel you are still reading a paper book. It does not have a back light but to be honest I don't find myself reading in he dark very often.Pros- Books Are Cheaper- Take Notes Easier While Reading- Find Definitions of Words in Seconds- Having Hundreds of Books On Hand Any TimeCons- No Back Light"
"585","It really is small"
"586","This particular Kindle is what it is!  It would have been great if someone would have thought of putting either a brightness screen or some kind of light within the Kindle.  It is useless at night when one is trying to read while in bed.  You need to have a mini light attached to it or have a lamp on.  Unhappy!"
"587","Hard to turn off."
"588","We've used all sorts of tablets but not a kindle so we tried the least expensive one when it was on sale. I have to say I really like it, even though its the cheapest option. Its fairly easy to use, easy to read in the light and extremely light. Its something we can take with us wherever and you never have to worry about storage or battery life. Would recommend a kindle to anyone who even marginally likes to read, travels, etc."
"589","I prefer my Chromebook since it's color, has email and web, while light and enough battery for use around the house unplugged. The Keyboard acts as a nice prop for reading in bed, on the couch or at a table.So I bought the Kindle for outside the house where the super-long battery life is required (backpacking and international travel).What I don't like about Kindle is that books I have checked out from my local public library can't be returned when finished (or unfinished if I've decided I don't want to read it), and they count against my limit at the library so I can't check out something new until the 3 week lending period expires.I also don't like that I can't read The Economist (a news magazine I pay for) using their app on my Chromebook, and the Kindle. I have to choose between the two devices (and it costs more on the Kindle, and is in black and white, so I read it on my Chromebook which is fine most of the time except when traveling when the longer battery life would be make Kindle a better choice)."
"590","This is a very basic e-reader which is exactly what I wanted to go with my Kindle Fire..I use in bright daylight as there is NO glare and can read when my Fire is charging.  My generation 2 Kindle died and I had been using it as mentioned.  After a week, I decided I wanted this backup.  Very affordable.  Works great as simply an e-reader."
"591","I can only get it to bringup the old testament, am unable to retrieve the new testament or move from chapter too chapter. It is not taking commands well , will not enlarge fonts on request. I'm feeling like I made an expensive mistake in this item could be it just cant do what I need . Thank you , G. G.(Gary) McCombs."
"592","I am extremely disappointed in my 2 year old Kindle. Suddenly ti lost connection  to my WiFi on it.  The WiFi works on our 2 laptops and a Kindle Fire.  Two years on a product that my son saved his money to purchase this for me is a shame.  It was not used frequently. I called tech support and was on the phone for about  2 hours.  The enjoyment of having a book displayed instantly is a 5 star.  Unfortunately the longevity is a 0 star thus my low rating."
"593","Upgraders beware. There is no text to speech feature."
"594","I love the kindle. Seriously, I love it. First of all, it is great for keeping me focused on my reading because there is only the option of reading. I always read on my kindle instead of my iPad, because of 5 reasons...1: The kindle has the backlight, so there isn't glare, making it very easy for me to read books, even at the beach. The iPad? Not so much.2. It's so light! The iPad is very heavy, but this fits in my purse, backpack, you name it!3. Free books! (A Christmas Carol, for example.  My brother and sister read it over holiday break)4: It's so easy to change the settings on the Kindle. They offer about 8 different fonts, brightness level and shows how many more minutes in the chapter.5: Through the public e-library, I can download books from the huge e-library database onto my kindle and rent them for up to 3 weeks! It is so useful, its just like the regular library, downloads within seconds onto my kindle. Perfect. know other products do this, but it is so useful! I love the kindle, definitely recommend it!"
"595","Just not good enough."
"596","I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at $79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because $119 to $400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at $79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter. That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for $15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or $20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark"
"597","Was not bright enough"
"598","It's easy to read, but every few pages it goes to a page where it says, Kindle is restarting,"" or something like that.  I then have to wait about 40 seconds for it to do its thing.  Then it takes me to a page that's about fifteen pages *before* the page I was on.  So I have to keep tapping on the screen to get up to where I was. In addtion, there's no page number listed.  I may go back to regular books."
"599","My Daughter loves it."
"600","Love this kindle.  I have problem with dry eyes and reading makes that worse especially with the newer computer screens but this kindle is just like reading a real paper book and easy on the eyes.  I love I can adjust the print bigger so reading is a breeze.  I would definitely recommend for reading books for pleasure but I would not  recommend for books with pictures or reference books that you need to be referring back and forth.  I had ordered a book with a lot of diagrams and they were hard to see so I ended up ordering the hardcover edition."
"601","I purchased the Kindle today (7/15/15) and received it the same day. Excited to use the Kindle, I opened the box and there it was, with the screen showing a picture of the kindle itself and an arrow pointing to the power button with several different languages saying ""power on.""  I charged it and they proceeded to turn on the Kindle but it did not turn on. I checked the user manuals on the amazon website and nothing helped me. I am planning to return it and hopefully receive a device that is working."
"602","I love everything about it. I love that I have a trillion books to choose from in MY favorite genres. I love that they were all FREE from the library or other sites. The Kindle weighs the same (or lighter) than paper books, keeps my spot, the charge has lasted me one full week so far and I hear that it can last up to 2.5 weeks with regular nightly use. I love that I don't have to worry about lack of space to store my books. I'm looking forward to sharing my books with my friends. I love that I can sit anywhere in my very bright apartment where I have windows floor-to-ceiling without a glare! I'm looking forward to sitting on my balcony and at the beach, too. I can't do that with my Kindle Fire or my Ipad or my cell phone.I bought the Elsse For Kindle 6"" Glare Free - Folio Case Cover for Kindle (7th Generation), Dark Blue. This rich, quality leather cover is a perfect fit without adding a ton of weight."
"603","Didn't have a backlight."
"604","I had a keyboard kindle for many years, and am now trying to find a replacement. I now use my Kindle Fire Hd. When I received this tiny little kindle it felt like a child's toy.  I had no trouble with registration, tho it is different, nor was there any glitch with transferring all content.  First, I do not like the type of Homepage. You can only see a few books at a time. Pulling them up requires several different moves. Other content such as ""definition"" constantly pop up when barely hovering over a word. Secondly, the most annoying feature, in swiping A  page, many many times it will swipe several, then going back, it will swipe many more. So I constantly have to be aware of the percent sign at the bottom of the page. That is VERY interrupting to reading fluidly. I am giving up and going to see about returning it. It is way too much trouble, something I never experienced with my Kindle with buttons, or my Fire with swiping."
"605","This is my 3rd Kindle Paperwhite.  I loved my first one, then it inexplicably died.  I replaced it with the current model at the time, which I never liked.  Then that one died (the curser wouldn't work so I couldn't pick a book etc.).  So I was hesitant to replace it, but it is a good deal better than the other model and easier to use.  Also easier to order more books.  I also had the first model of the Kindle Fire, which stopped charging, which is a huge disappointment as I like the option of the light for reading at night.  My husband still has the first model of the Kindle Paperwhite and it still works great, so I decided to try again."
"606","I love Kindle.  So easy to buy or borrow books from Amazon, and it is smaller and lighter than carrying a book with you.  This is my second one, plus I use the Kindle app on my iPad.  About this one: I think the size is too small for me, I'd prefer that the pages be more paperback book sized.  Also the advertisements are super annoying and they do drain the battery some so if you don't use it for a month it will need to be charged.  Those two reasons give it a low rating in my book - I wouldnt buy this again."
"607","Can't read in the dark. Didn't realize that it didn't have a light. Not easy to use.  Some areas underlined that I didn't initiate, why.  Wish that I could buy the original Fire Kindle. My first, second and third Kindles were great. I had to buy another since mine won't turn on anymore. So sad. Also bought your tablet, hardly lasts a full day, worthless."
"608","does not have back  light"
"609","neat and tidy but limited"
"610","I thought it would do  more"
"611","not what I thought returned"
"612","The product doesn't work right, I have a book from the library in there but it won't open unless my on the internet which I don't have and the instructions on your website says otherwise , I'm tired of paying for something outside and then have to pay shipping and handling out of my own pocket to replace or fix it, I'm not sure if l'm going to send it back and not read anymore, or give another try.Thank you very much .donald.lynch82@yahoo.com"
"613","Stop working after 7 month"
"614","not intuitive---NOT Apple!"
"615","I hate it.  My old kindle finally gave way and I am trying to figure out this kindles.  Pages confusing I have order two books by accident.  I don't need to see the covers of the books I have on this kindle the older kindle just had a list with the title and author which was perfect .  When you finished you just send the book to your archives.  I have no idea how to send the books to the archives when finished on this thing.  HELP."
"616","don't like it. very slow ."
"617","I really like the paperwhite Kindle.  There are a few ease of access issues and all kindles seem to desperately want you to use the Cloud drive now, but I love the lack of eye strain and the huge memory.  Really, I can put loads of books on there.  I hate touch screens and all those finger marks that go with them, but this one isn't all that bad as far as they go.  It must be the glare free screen, the the finger marks are not as bad.  I don't much like the adds but they can be ignored just fine.  It is so lightweight and small (about like some paperbacks) I can just stick it in my bag."
"618","Great for reading during the day. So many free or almost free books available. The only thing I think is off about it they claim the adds do not drain the battery. I knew I wasn't going to use it for a while so I charged it and left it for about 4 weeks. When I used it again, the battery was almost completely drained. So either the adds do drain it, or the battery loses it charge in about a month. Either way I still love it, I would recommend you wait till its on sale. Its a little high for just a reader, but you can justify it if you read a ton of free books."
"619","Does not support epub format.Does not display page number, or page number/total, instead says something like loc 134.(There is % display, though.)Also, it does not support organizing books in folders."
"620","the performance is too poor!"
"621","Can not read in dark room!!!"
"622","I wish that it had a light on the screen so I could read at night"
"623","toooooooooooo expensive!!!!"
"624","Great upgrade!!! I had the older kindle; I bought it to replace older model because I liked the fact that it was touch screen and it was so easy to set up.  The only con is that the home page font is a tad smaller to read and this is not adjustable but everything else is great, the light weight makes it so comfortable and screen display is perfect in the day time to read.  I love it!"
"625","This was a big change from my normal Kindle with the touch keypad.  I loved that thing so much, but I had to get caught up with the times and get a new one... something more compact that would be a better traveling partner for me.  I like this one, but miss the other one I had (still own it, I haven't been able to let go yet).  I am still trying to figure out how this thing works."
"626","I am pleased with it. One reason I purchased it. I am going over seas and needed something light weight.I did not want to carry a large amount of books. This is perfect."
"627","Ok, I'm giving it four stars because it works well. But I only use it as a backup because, believe it or not, that back light is a very important feature, and this Kindle does not have it. I bought it, thinking that I can just read it like a book with the lights on, but, it's not that easy. After having a back lighted Kindle for so long ( I thought it died, which is why I bought a new one - it didn't really, it was just frozen - so maybe it's in the process of dying? Anyway....) Going to this one was too much of a hassle. So I wound up buying a new Paperwhite within a couple weeks. I didn't return this one though, because there's nothing wrong with it - as long as the light is on.  :)"
"628","What a lightweight easy to read Kindle! I got mine with a special offer which made it even more sweet! For traveling, going to the beach, or just taking to the office, this Kindle will not let you down."
"629","Device is good, but be aware that if you buy it with a discount, you have all these crappy ads that pop up on the device.  It isn't even tailored to my preferences, which is sucky.  If you want to get them off, you have to pay the difference from the discount you had."
"630","pretty good, like it very much."
"631","No light for nitetime reading"
"632","The recent black Friday sales on this unit convinced me to purchase a replacement for a five year old Kindle that was losing contrast (or maybe it was my eyes). At any rate the glare free unit is small, but with a viewable screen the same size as my original. How? the touch screen capability replacing the side direction keys and the keyboard. The readability is darn near amazing, allowing these old eyes to read in subdued light. I personally do not find the ads to be a problem, especially since you can turn the screen to blank if you desire. I find most of the ads interesting as they generally refer to books I might like to read. Battery life is good, but it is too early to tell if this will last. The unit is very light (hence the battery concern) and very portable. The charger cube does not exist on this unit, but since it is a micro usb, your phone changer will likely work. Charging time appears to be reasonable, I had approx. two week of reading nightly, which showed about half battery usage. It recharged to full (indicated by the green LED display along the bottom edge, in about an hour. I would recommend to a friend , especially at the sale price."
"633","The brightness is not adjustable"
"634","I really enjoy this Kindle.I like using the look up for words with which I'm unfamiliar.I like being able to easily find out who a character is, as I'm not remembering the minor characters as well as I did as a youngster.  I like using this function to get a bit more historical data on real characters, as well.The reading surface easily accommodates dim to bright light.I also like being able to swipe or touch the screen to turn a page. It used to be difficult to go between my Kindle and my tablet because I wanted to swipe my older Kindle.  ; D"
"635","I had heard and read that the Kindle with the paperwhite could cause problems with sleep patterns. I had been reading at night primarily and was having insomnia. That is why I ordered the Kindle glare free screen. It also had the touch screen that I had with my other Kindle. I have really been happy with this purchase. I no longer have the insomnia and have all the  touch screen ability of my other Kindle. This new Kindle also has a long battery life.Over all I am very happy with this purchase."
"636","Loved my first Kindle with the keyboard.  I am not as happy with this one. Grip: All the books are stored in the cloud (what ever that is) with no separation from books that have been read. If one is a voracious reader, at book a day or at least 4 books a week. There is no longer an ""Archive"" for books read only the cloud.  I have a little over 1600 books. Books that are removed from ""Device"" return to the cloud and are first in the queue. This system forces me to dig through everything I have already read to find new reading material.  It will skip several pages, at once, if care is not taken when trying to turn pages. The images of the bookcovers are so small it is almost impossible to read the titles when looking at queued books. With any type of vision impairment it would be impossible. I preferred having the list of unread books written out in order of purchase or in sequence if a series. Yes it is smaller as there is no longer a keyboard. It is a bit lighter but not enough to hold with just one hand IF one is older and arthritic. All in all, I would love to have my old Kindle back or at least have the option of replacing with that same model.  Sorry Amazon, you blew it with this one."
"637","who wants to read of a gray background?"
"638","hate this one. screen is very dark."
"639","Its hard to read with no light and it all looks blurry. Wasn't happy with it at all!"
"640","I have both a Kindle Fire HD and this 7th generation Kindle 6"". I love both of them for different reasons. I take the Kindle 7th generation with me everywhere. It's extremely light and perfectly sized to fit into my purse. The display is easy on the eyes and the touch-screen makes page-turning a breeze. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a basic, entry-level e-reader."
"641","I wish I had picked a different Kindle, instead of this one.  It works good, and I can read my books anywhere.  I have trouble finding my place and, I find, that the instructions are not clear.  I have to search for answers, which takes more time then I want to spend.  I would rather be reading my book.Another complaint I have is that there is no way to make the screen lighter or brighter so I can see the words when I am in a darker place, I have to turn on a lamp or something.Good news is that it works almost like magic when I am outside even in the sun!"
"642","I had the very first kindle and I loved the idea of it. about 3 years ago it died completely. It just stopped charging. I decided to get something new and looked at the kindle fire HD.  Previously I bought an i Pad for my dad for Christmas and he loved it. So i decided to get an i Pad as i could use the kindle app and a bunch of other things on it.  I don't regret getting the i pad but I found that I didn't use the kindle app on it as much because reading on it after a while bothered my eyes.  I saw the promotion for this kindle for 29 dollars and thought what the heck I miss my old kindle why not try the new one for 29 dollars.Its a basic kindle e reader it does its basic job well.  I find it easier to navigate over the first kindle. Its nice and small but not too small and lightweight. I have only been using for about 3 hours but I love it.  especially since I wont get distracted by other bells and whistles.  For 29 dollars this was a great purchase.  I have a feeling they may be phasing this model out or getting ready to release a new model.I am not bothered by not having a keyboard or page turning buttons.  Its very basic and that it what I like about it.  I read a review where someone mentioned having the background a little lighter grey and I agree but its nothing a book light or good lighting wouldn't fix.Overall I am thrilled with this purchase at such a great price.  However If I were to pay full price I would probably splurge and get the paper-white. Also I was worried about the ads, but they really don't bother me. I quite like the suggestions that they provide.I decided to get the Infiland Amazon Kindle 2014 7th Gen case for 11 dollars over spending more on a case than I paid for the kindle itself and it isn't perfect but it does its job as well."
"643","I've only had the Kindle for a couple of weeks but I do love it.  Do I miss the feeling for the good old printed books?  Yes, however, the ease of buying books and having them immediately without having to go to a store and buy them or library in hopes that they have the book I wish to read is gone and that's not a bad thing.  Getting my book immediately and for a lower cost than the hard copies is a big plus.  Also the light weight of the Kindle is excellent.  I like to read in bed and my arms and hands no longer get tired or cramped with the Kindle.  So, overall, and so far, the Kindle has lived up to its expectations and I am very pleased with it.  Now, when asked, I can request Amazon gift cards for e-books.  Keeping in mind that I have no other Kindles to compare this to, I do recommend this Kindle because of its' ease of obtaining books immediately and the ease of use."
"644","Will be returning  it, back light needed"
"645","I wish it had a light for night reading."
"646","Easy to use and great way to hold my books. I am not a tech savvy person, but found this very easy to navigate and was able to turn off all the suggested books on home page to make the Kindle an ad-free tool"
"647","I absolutely love my new Kindle. It is going to be hard to retire my Kindle Keyboard, which has served me very well. However, the keyboard on the new Kindle is much easier to use, and it has more features than the Kindle Keyboard.  The only thing that I am not as crazy about on my new Kindle, is that the edge has been squared off instead of having a more gentle, rounded, sloping edge.  I notice that my husband's Paperwhite also has the more sloping, rounded edge, which is a tad easier to hold. The squared off edge, as Kindle 6"" Glare-Free has, is a tad less comfortable, but I am sure I will get used to it, especially with all of the new features. I guess it is just hard to give up my old friend, the Keyboard.  It became a close companion.  But I look forward to making my new Kindle just as close a companion."
"648","Is not user friendly, can not download games."
"649","Very hard to download from other than Amazon."
"650","It's not backlit; can't read it in the dark"
"651","no setting for backlit brightness - My eyes are straining -  too difficult to read -  so I am sending back."
"652","For a strict e reader this product is good. I always use a book light and I can truly say it does have an appearance of a real book which I enjoy. It doesn't have a glare and battery life is outstanding. Been using mine for a solid week for hours at a time and battery hasn't budged. Prices for books on the kindle are also very affordable and cheaper than regular books which is nice."
"653","Easier to read than the kindle app for phone and other devices (which i intend to keep using), and knows where you left off reading on the last device you were reading.  very handy having all your books together.having the screen never really turn off is a bit unsettling, but the battery does last for weeks, as they describe, so it is OK."
"654","Way too dark and really puts a strain on my eyes."
"655","I like the display on the original much better!!"
"656","It does not seem to have a lighted screen...so you cannot not read in a dark room. I was VERY disappointed with that..."
"657","I received a Kindle 5-way as a xmas present three or so years ago. I was hooked. I loved it so much that I bought a Kindlefire HDX Wi-Fi with 64 gig of memory for my wife. She was too afraid to use it. But I loved it  The resident geni in the box, makes it the MOST of the very best of any tablet of any brand. I always have both kindles running at the same time 24/7. Amazon's Kindle 5-way is by far the best for finding and buying books. The FireHDX is best at reading them for you. And a thousand other things.The new Kindle Touchscreen screams plastic and cheap. But it has more capacity (I have more than a thousand Titles Any Idea how large the Catholic Encyclopedia is?) and battery life than the 5-Way, and I swear, it is lighter and thinner also.  Amaz0n continues to knock the ball out of the park."
"658","I absolutely love this Kindle!  It's compact, lightweight, fits in my hands well and the screen print is dark and easy to read.  But most importantly, it's so easy to use!  The touchscreen makes navigation a breeze.  Believe me if I can do it, so can you.  I tend to shy away from trying new gadgets fearing I won't be able to operate them.  I needn't have worried with this Kindle.  Right out of the box, I turned it on and the screen prompts took me through the set up process which took less than 5 minutes.  I currently have a 1st generation Nook that I have loved for years.  But it doesn't compare to the Kindle.  The Nook is larger, heavier, has more navigation steps, the print is so much lighter, and sometimes the formatting is off.  For these reasons, I'm retiring it in favor of the Kindle.  You can't go wrong with this ereader; I think you'll enjoy it just as much as I enjoy mine."
"659","This is our second kindle, as we wore the first one out!  My husband is visually impaired and this product meets his needs and more.  The no glare screen is perfect and the size and weight make it more usable than an iPad  for him.  We will always have a kindle for him."
"660","no lit background I thought it was when I bought it"
"661","not what expected, will pay more attetion next time"
"662","After finally receiving the Kindle I am not sure if I am please as I should be.  #! is stated ""Includes special Offers""  I have not seen any of these and I was looking for a simple case for this and It is too confusing as to what case I need for it.  I have been very happy with Amazon before this order and am hoping that this will not a problem in the future.  It took 15 days to get this order and that was the replacement that was sent out after the first one got lost from usps.  Cases for the Kindle are to many for different versions and not simple to find a basic case for this one.  I am almost more please with my daughters very  first version of the Kindle that I have had for 2 years.This has been my worse experience with Amazon and I hope to not have more in the future."
"663","I thought it was going be a simple version of my kindle fire. No such thing. Dull screen. Not very intuitive.  Very unsatisfied"
"664","At this point every kindle should have self light."
"665","I had been curious about the Kindle for a while since I like the concept of e-books but reading on my Android tablet was not comfortable. The e-reader is light, the ink is clear and my eyes are not strained. I am looking forward to reading many books and other publications on my Kindle."
"666","great little Kindle, love the size and the reading screen, but absolutely shocked to find the kind of adds popping up on the bottom of the home page.  AND then the recommended reads!!!!  Are you serious??  'Wet girls picture book'????  I bought this for my 9 year old and it's ridiculous that even on a reading devise she is exposed to completely inappropriate things.  All i wanted for her was to have something to read her good reads on.  Does anyone know how to block these things?"
"667","Ha, they said this item was used, and in good condition, showing wear and tear from use. I got mine today and it looked brand-spanking new, not a scratch or scuff on it! connected to my wifi, got all my books downloaded, and started reading right away without any issues. I would also like to note that they actually do have a web browser on this device, it says it's experimental, but it works in case you were interested."
"668","I have the previous version, without touchscreen. My bf wants a Kindle and this new edition comes out. He got it and thinks it is much better than my non-touchscreen one. I guess so. So much easier to navigate with this one. Only thing i think the old version is better is that the older version is thinner and lighter. This is a little bit thicker. It is a little harder to hold it in one hand for me. But than again, touchscreen makes navigation so much easier. Can't beat that."
"669","OMG! Love. love, love the 6"" size!! Fits right inside my purse. Great for reading on the go; as I so often do. I have a larger reader but, now I actually prefer this smaller Kindle. Has all the features as my larger one but, so easy to carry from point to point. Can't wait to take it on vacation. Thank you Amazon for this smaller version of the E-Readers.."
"670","It  shipped Fast but not exactly what I was expecting"
"671","I have been using the kindle app on my iPad to read books but with limited memory, I figured I should buy a Kindle.  I like it but the format took some getting use to.  I had it for less than a week before I sent this Kindle reader back, realizing that I need more light to read by.  I bought the Kindle paperwhite instead."
"672","Good battery life, easy to carry, good value.  Let me repeat what many other reviews have said, this e-reader does NOT have a backlight.  It is clear and easy to read outside, but if you are looking for a device to use in low light, or bedtime reading, you should select a different model.  I use the Kindle app on my Samsung Tablet for reading indoors or in low light.  Through wifi, the devices synch up and remember your place so transferring between devices is easy."
"673","It is enough different from the older model, that it takes some time to learn its operation. We found it touchy in that one can get unexpected sub-windows unexpectedly by touching either the top or bottom of the screen. Once one learns that these areas are where the menus are brought forth, it is easy enough to avoid while advancing or paging back. The screen is very sensitive so that it is easy to skip pages. A disadvantage is that there is no indication of what percentage of the book is read, or what page is on screen. The idea of minutes remaining to read the chapter on screen is of little value. Learned one neat advantage of Kindles. I have two, if reading a book on one and switching to the second, the option of going to the page being read is made possible. Really an appreciated feature. All in all, the new touch screen model is OK, easy to use once mastered and holds a charge for a long time."
"674","I bought this for my daughter who, with the Holidays, has not had a lot of time to use it. I thought I would 'check it out' for her so I could give her some pointers when she had time to search the offerings of titles. I found a series I was very much drawn to and ended up ""buying"" the first book in the series for $0.00! The other four books are ones I can borrow using the Prime features. Well you can't beat that with a stick, as my great grandmother used to say. I have also found several stories (I only looked through the first 35 titles) my daughter can borrow for my granddaughter who is 7. I have no fear of any similar titles to children's literature that is anything but for children getting viewed because of the ability to create a child safe reading environment with password controls. I have to say thanks to Amazon for providing such an extensive lending library. Also, looking at the prices of books for purchase, all that I looked at were less than half the price of a new bound book. If you love to read but cost and the sometimes awkward visual book covers/titles keep you from your love of reading anywhere and everywhere...this eReader is the maker of your dream come true."
"675","screen is to dark to read without a bright light beside"
"676","I wish you could adjust the brightness of this Kindle."
"677","It does not read well at night - thought ir would...."
"678","I really thought I was upgrading from my Kindle Keyboard when I purchased this item. While the touchscreen is responsive and its easy to reading, I realized that in this item I gave up one of my favorite features of my previous model- audiobooks. No speakers, no place to plug in head phones, I use public transportation to get everywhere and having the Kindle out to read is not always an option but I could always pick it right up with the audiobooks, well no more. I'm greatly disappointed, to the point that I am contemplating returning this item so I can use the funds to go purchase a used prior model with audio."
"679","I have a Kindle Fire and I like this SOOO much better from a ereading stand point. On my Fire you can't create collections and I am a very organized person. I have all my books organized my author and series. And it's so light! The only downside is that it is not back lit so you can't read it in the dark unless you have a reading light which are really easy to come by and super cheap. Just find a case that you can clip a light to and it becomes a non issue."
"680","Just got my 6"" touchscreen paperwhite Kindle yesterday. Already loving being able to read WITHOUT the screen shining in my eyes. Amazon shipped it already set up for my account so it was just a matter of Turing it on and running through a simple setup menue.I can read outdoors again, something I've missed using a tablet. With the paperwhite screen the brighter the light the better the screen shows up.Ultra light, clear high contrast print, pocket sized... better than a book when you are on the go."
"681","A perfect and convenient companion for reading.  I love real books and am not one to discard favorites to which I have become emotionally attached. Shelf space has run out so this is ideal for pure reading enjoyment and convenienceNo need for other ""stuff"" or backlight.  If it's dark I turn on a light or just go to sleep.  It's my second one and I have purchased a third for a grandchildPlease DO NOT ""improve"" this modelIt is perfect for reading and needs no fixingA good product, good quality, good value."
"682","No there wasn't any special offers. But I do like the device"
"683","Have not been able to load any of the games which my wife has on her Kindle which is 2 years older!!!What's with that??Cant figure"
"684","Very disappointed in not being able to read in low light."
"685","Due to small screen and slow performance, didn't like it."
"686","I broke down and purchased this kindle after hemming and hawing between it and the paperwhite.This is a terrific device. I can hold it comfortably in my hand for long periods of time. The light issue isn't a big deal to me (which is why I didn't splurge the $40).I wanted a device to hold the many e-books I review instead of using a tablet's screen. Once you purchase an e-book though, it's a challenge to justify the more expensive paper books."
"687","This is a great eReader and does a great job for the upgrade. But I was having a problem with reading in darker lit rooms so I opted to return this one and get the Paperwhite, which I LOVE! It has everything this one has to offer but the backlight allows me to read no matter where I am! Worth the extra money!"
"688","I'm a simple person and I've fallen in love with the simplicity of my kindle! I would have loved a back light but other than that I bring it everywhere I go, it's lightweight and doesn't drag my purse down and I have unlimited books anywhere! Its easy to navigate on and love how I can purchase a book on the app from my phone and sincs to my kindle with Wi-Fi. One of the best purchases I've ever made! Definitely beats buying a new book every week and trying to find somewhere to store it."
"689","I wanted a reader that I could take out to the pool and read.  This works perfectly.  You can read it even in the bright Texas sun.  Perfect!  My only beef is not with the reader but the cases available for the reader....Not one case sold for the reader will stand on it's own.  Really need a case that will fold into a stand!"
"690","First, I'm not the most familiar person when it comes to the kindle devices. with this kindle, at first glance it looked weird, felt weird ( it really is as light as a feather) and it took some getting used to.. Esp since the only kindle I've ever used was the fire. Now that I've used it a little I really like it. The kindle fire is nice if you want a tablet, but for reading books as your primary focus, it is just too bulky. This kindle is easy to handle, light and easy to transport. It seems perfect to carry in a backpack or take camping due to the small size. If you're a female, you could prob carry this in your purse with no problem (I've seen bigger things pulled out of a woman's purse) lol. The only thing I notice (in my opinion) it seems a little harder to read in the dark then the fire.. Maybe there is a setting for this ? I think I will buy a light for it though. Overall, if you are looking for a light kindle without the bulkyness of the fire, this is highly recommended."
"691","I have always like the feel of a book in my hands and figured I would not get use to a kindle. My wife has had one for several years, I purchased one on a Wednesday and took it on a long weekend trip. reading on the plane was so easy, so was the beach and by the pool. I would recommend that the first book you read is an author that you know you will like!"
"692","I can't say that I LOVE this new e reader....my old kindle is the best and I still find myself using it.  I purchased this to see what's new, well, not much.....I hate turning pages and dislike all the other NEWER ways to find things....guess I'm old fashioned and I say ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!!"
"693","I'm pretty disappointed in the Kindle I purchased as it doesn't have a backlight my wife reads at night before bed and has to have the bedside lamp on to use it"
"694","Have not used it yet Going on a cruise will try it then"
"695","Pretty much as expectedDont like the swipe to open, tho"
"696","Didn't pay attention and bought this model without the light feature. If you arie considering buying this product, do pick the model with the light built. It is totally worthy paying a few more bucks."
"697","😊"
"698","4*"
"699","I just took my new Kindle out of the box and I'm already in love with it. Setup was rather easy and the tutorial was easy enough to follow along. It didn't take long for me to get it up and running so I could finally read a book on it."
"700","This unit replaces my original Kindle, It's a great product once you learn how to use it. They should include a printed list of shortcuts to help you get started. I had to keep calling tech support, they gave me the feeling that I knew more than they did to solve problems that i could not find answers to on kindle tutorial. It was a frustrating 2 days for this engineer who was at the beginning of the solid state revolution in Silicon Valle.y"
"701","I love this Glare-Free touchscreen display because I use it outdoors all the time.  I love being able to read it in the bright sunshine as I live in Florida and it is usually very sunny.  I also take it to the beach with me."
"702","NIce and lightweight. Helps me get through the backlog of books."
"703","It came without light... Is it that way or can I have a new one"
"704","difficult to navigate  I was used to ease of my first 2 kindles"
"705","sent back didn't have light. was for my mom who has eye sight problems"
"706","I like the Kindle 6 with the exception that it doesn't have a light."
"707","I have owned several Kindles over the past few years, most of which I have given to friends and family.  Recently, I realized I had given away my last Kindle Paperwhite to a friend, so back to Amazon I went to get another.  When i saw this particular model on sale, I bought it immediately.  It arrived well packaged and two days sooner than predicted.Now I've read a couple of reviews where people had trouble switching the language when the Kindle first arrived.  Charge it up first. I had the same trouble before I had the forehead smacking moment of ""Duh"", you need to charge it first.  Once done, I had no trouble.My only complaint and it's not even really that, is that this particular model is not back lit.  No real issue there as I have a clip on book reading lamp that works perfectly well for night time reading.My greatest love of this model is that it is so very light!  I love that it doesn't hurt my hands to hold it for long periods of time.  This Kindle is perfect for those who travel quite a bit and do not want to be carrying a heavier Kindle along.  It's also perfect for those who have trouble holding a book for long periods of reading.So remember, if you want an e-reader that is light weight and easy to use, I highly recommend this model.  Just remember, if you want to read in the dark, either buy a book light or choose one of the other models."
"708","I bought a 5th generation Kindle back in May.  It was my first e-reader.  I liked it a lot.  Then I saw that the Kindle was being offered in a touchscreen.  I thought ""I just bought a Kindle! I don't need to buy the newest model.""  The price was $79.00.  (I only spent $49.00 on my first Kindle)  I then realized that I could trade in my old Kindle and get a gift card.  I then saw the touch-screen Kindle was being offered for $49.00 on Black Friday.  I could not pass this up.  I got my new  Kindle last week and I love it!The touch-screen did take a little bit of getting used to.  After a day of use, I found I liked the touch screen better than the page turn buttons.  I found highlighting to be a lot easier.  This kindle actually highlights the passage instead of underline.I love the new features on the Touch screen Kindle.  I love having Goodreads right there on the menu.  I use Goodreads all the time and it is much easier to update what books I am reading.  I really love the Page Flip feature so that I can go anywhere in the book and not have to constantly turn the page and lose my place.  The new ""about this book feature"" is great since you can mark the book ""currently reading"" on Goodreads.  It also tells you if the book is part of a series.  X-ray this book is a good feature because you can go to the dictionary and Wikipedia without leaving the book.  The Touch keyboard is a lot easier to use than the old Kindle.  Writing notes is a lot easier.I had very few problems with the Touch screen Kindle.  The main problem was getting all my books transferred onto it.  I had some books on my old Kindle that I transferred with a USB cable, so they were not on the Cloud. I could not open the books so,  I ended up having to re-buy two books.  The ""Cloud"" and the ""Device"" sections took some getting used to.  I have a lot of books I borrow from the library and they show up on the Cloud.  Some books have the loan ended, so I had to make an ""archive"" collection.I wish the Touch Screen Kindle had more font choices.  On the old Kindle you had a lot more choices.  I like Times New Roman san serif.  I like the plainness of it.I am very satisfied with my touch screen Kindle, for now.  (I might in the future trade it in for a Kindle Fire)"
"709","I have had a kindle for about 4-5 years, the one with the keyboard. I love it and was very reluctant to switch to this new touch screen kindle. It went on sale and a friend had decided to get it for me for my birthday. I have to say, I did not want it, I was happy with what I had. However, after I used it I was in love. The things you can do on this amaze me. You can look everything up while in text. I can see the characters and read about them and as a history guy it helps that I can look things up via wikipedia right on the ereader. I absolutely love this, so much better than my kindle I had before."
"710","I'm loving this Kindle. I had a second generation that finally died, but this one is just the right size and I like the ease of page turning and the other option on the touch screen.  I don't like a back lite screen and it's so much lighter than reading on my iPad. I would definitely buy another if and when this one should ever go kaput.  Love it!"
"711","I love my kindle!  I received this as a gift and have fallen in love.  I have never used an e-reader and was surprised by the comfort of the kindle and the readability of the device.  I highly recommend this model.  I have been converted!"
"712","It's ok.  Not really what I hoped for.  Not sure if I'll send it back yet."
"713","I don't know if I have this one of not. I have so many. from the button turn page and keyboard  to the first paperwhite the next paper white, and the small fire and big fire not the big big one. cant afford it. can you tell, I love my kindles and yes love is the word. I have different books on all. bye the way have given up and don't use the ones with the button page.and key boards. kindle,, how about taking them in for trade on the big fire. lol."
"714","Disappointed. I was not able to read my first selection of children's books - the text ran off the page at all font sizes. Secondly, it was really hard to find the free children's books in Free Time Unlimited. While I love the gorgeous black and white screen and built in dictionary - I generally found the device harder to use that I had hoped. Going back to the home screen took some learning. I was stuck on one book trying to get out for about 5 mins."
"715","It was advertised as something for kids and it is not.  Not happy at all."
"716","I was disappointed.  My previous Kindle reader had a built-in led light that was much more efficient than the separate light I was required to buy if I wanted to read in bed. This light does not adequately light the full screen and gets in the way."
"717","Not happy!  I had an earlier touch screen...it came with sound capability and WiFi so you could order kindle books from Amazon....the new one has none of these plus it just appears cheap."
"718","After having spent the last few days playing with my new Kindle I am thrilled with the simplicity of the device. I'm no stranger to the Kindle and what it has to offer. This is...in my opinion a very basic model in comparison to the Kindle Fire model. There really aren't that many thrilling perks to this one but it works well. If you plan to watch videos, movies, etc then I would go with the Kindle Fire model or better. The 7th generation is clearly more for the avid reader that just wants an ereader. The ability to set up collections for your books is easy. The download of new books or transfer of advance reader copies via review sites is simply and fast. As a bonus the deliver was super fast. Thanks Amazon!"
"719","This is my 3rd Kindle and I love it.  This is even nicer than the second one I purchased (with the light).  It's easier to use  and the price was very good.  Whenever I have an appointment, I take my kindle along with me and it makes the waiting time go faster.  I enjoy the books I purchase and the ones I get to read for free.  The variety of Kindle books is  wonderful.  This is just one reason why I love  Amazon so much.Thanks, Amazon."
"720","I read a lot. I have worn out the buttons on 3 Kindles in the past and lost my last one at the airport. So, bought the new touchscreen. It's bad.  The pages are constantly freezing and I'm currently waiting for the battery to run down because it won't even let me turn the Kindle off to try to reset it.  The page turn is slow and I am constantly overreading the page turns. That is I do when it doesn't read my touch as a signal to define a word (usually ""the"" ) or highlight a section of print.  I've had this less that a month and am serious about returning it.  GAH!  Worst Kindle ever!"
"721","excelent first kindle.. i gave 2 as gift and they area being used intensively. I knew this one did not have the backlight and to be frank at night or in low light you need a lamp. Not critizicing this kindle as it is very clear to see with a lamp just as a book would, maybe even better but with all the advantages of being a kindle and carrying many books with you. You can also send documents like word or pdf to it via email whic is nice to carry technical papers and manuals with you. It is light, small and easy to hold up for extended time. Highly recomended for the avid reade and traveler. Consider the model with light if you are like me and read mostly at night."
"722","I love it. I purchased this as a Black Friday huge deal as a ""why not"" test and couldn't be happier. I am a public transit user and this is so much simpler than lugging a book around. Not to mention the ease of ""borrowing"" free books from the library without having to go to the library! There's no back light and no keypad, but I can download and read books, which is all I ask for."
"723","I should have more options of free books and little increase in brightness."
"724","I knew it was small when I bought it, but I still wish it was bigger.  I would have given it 5 stars then.  Other than that no complaint. As promised. I also have arthritis in my hands, and this makes it easier to read being that it easier to hold than a new book, which is tight.."
"725","This is the fourth Kindle that I have purchased.  I like the fact that it can be read without glare.  When I registered I put it on my old account, so I would be able to use books that are already in my Archived items.  Now, however, I cannot figure out how to transfer the many books that I have purchased to my new Kindle.  It says I have only 4 books.  I have always been very happy with past Kindles, and I would love to find this one as useful as others I own.  I am giving this a 5-star rating on my experience with past models and hope with the proper help I will be able to enjoy it to its fullest."
"726","I know it's my fault for getting the version with ads, however I wish they at least turned off after a few hours or so. Whenever I haven't read in a while, I come back to a dead kindle because the ads used up the battery life.Otherwise, the reading experience is fine! Figuring out the most comfortable to read using it took a little bit of time because you can't hold it like a paper book, but one it was figured out, all was good."
"727","This is the first kindle I have owned.  I needed the Kindle guide but found it easy to navigate.  I wasn't sure that I would like the screen but it reads like a book and does not make my eyes tired.  I have only downloaded two books so far but I am very happy with the results.  One thing that I was not aware of is that it is in black and white.  If you are downloading something that is in color, like beading books, color is very important.  I got the app and downloaded the beading book in color on my tablet.  I am really looking forward to taking the kindle on vacation.  Once the book is downloaded, wi-fi isn't neccessary.  It holds more books at a time than I can read in two weeks.  I wish I had purchased one sooner."
"728","This device feels like it was designed for children.  It's ONLY worthwhile feature is it's no-glare e-ink whatever. The most basic of smartphones renders the Kindle obsolete. Unless you read outside almost exclusively,  youre better off just using a tablet or your cellphone."
"729","Only trouble with this is there is no light. I guess you get what you pay for."
"730","Can't see this well without strong light and the back light is not adjustable."
"731","I was soo looking forward to getting this Kindle. I have decided to start reading again after a way too long hiatus. I was very shocked at the size of the kindle as it is only about 1 inch wider and as tall as my iPhone 6+. I am extremely disappointed at how dark the screen is. I did not realize there would not be a back light to adjust.  I spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out how to adjust font size as well. I finally called Amazon and the Customer Service Rep was unfamiliar with the product and kept putting my on hold. Finally I just asked her to send me the return labels which apparently she didn't know how to do. I had to call back and spoke with someone knowledgeable. I am still waiting for the return label. I will ship this back and try the next Kindle that has more features. If all else fails I will resort to an iPad Mini. I really only want a plain reader however."
"732","My Paperwhite fails to light up...can't read in shadows or dark. What to do?"
"733","I'm  still in the process off learning how to use all the features on this Kindle"
"734","Amazing"
"735","This is a really solid Kindle that provides great value for the price. My wife has an old school Kindle, the kind with the keyboard built into the body and the arrow buttons to move around. Oh my is that version incredibly difficult to navigate. So it's clear the Kindle has improved considerably from older models. The only real downside to this model is you cannot read when the lighting is low but it's a trade-off I will gladly accept for the great price.If you aren't looking for all the bells and whistles and are fine with a bare bones Kindle this is a great choice."
"736","Was working great but can't get it to move to home page now.  What should I do?"
"737","I read a lot. I use to like carry 3 or 4 books with me to work, just not knowing what mood I would be in during lunch. This has saved my sanity and my back. It took a while to become adjusted to the idea of buying digital copies of books. When I got over that, I did spend a bit of money to get my favorite reads on the Kindle and reread them all again, and because the Kindle is so comfortable, it was like reading them as a fresh experience.This coupled with Kindle Unlimited has saved me time and gas, as I'm no longer at the public library every week."
"738","Very disappointed with this. Was not worth the money at all! Very cheaply made."
"739","This e-reader is perfect! I use it everywhere...at home, at the beach, at the club, etc. At first I thought it might be a tad too small, but it fits in one hand for easy reading. Very easy to swipe with the thumb of he hand holding it in order to ""turn"" the page. I actually like the book ads that appear in sleep mode. (I found books to order/borrow.)"
"740","Perfect for someone like me who wants their phone to just be a phone with texting ability and my computer to sit on a desk and not be mobile. I use it to read when I go to the doctors office and arrive an hour before my appt because that's how my medical transportation does things or when in bed but not sleepy and my lady can enjoy my non-pestering companionship while using her laptop."
"741","I'm enjoying it. A nice solid ereader that is much better than the older $200+ competition.For reference, I got a nook tablet a few years back. Huge mistake. Wish I saved my money for this nice streamlined reader with all the features I could possibly need on handMy only regret? Not getting the one with a back screen."
"742","This device has brought me back to reading.  I have asthma aggravated by dust mites... who thrive in paper books.  I had given up my library habit (the worst kind of books for dust mite triggered asthma) entirely.  With the kindle and Indiana's Public Library Access Card, I can read ebooks from any library in Indiana at a low annual fee.  I am in heaven!  The fonts are really easy to change, so if my eyes are getting a little tired, two touches and the font is easier to read!  Book downloads happpen extremely fast, and I particularly enjoy the touch dictionary for unfamiliar words and terms.  Thank you Amazon!"
"743","I wanted a new basic ereader - this device seemed to fit the criteria, and the price was right.  It was easy to set up and connect with Amazon.  I like the different fonts offered on this device.  I also like the vocabulary builder, which remembers all words I have looked up while reading.  I have 2 older Kindle ereaders and am used to buttons to turn pages.  On this Kindle, the touchscreen page turning is OK, but once in awhile the page turning skips several pages(!!!), which can be frustrating.  I took off 2 stars for that because it is a big deal.  I'm still undecided if I will keep this Kindle or return it..."
"744","Doesn't have a back light. And couldn't find a cover with a light to order for it."
"745","I HADTHE LARGE SCREEN FOR EIGHT  YEARS AND LOVED IT  TIS IS FINE BUT NOT THE SAME"
"746","stopeed working within 15 minutes of purchasing device for an trip.  disappointed"
"747","Glare free screen is very nice but not as easy to navigate as my original kindle."
"748","THIS IS MY THIRD KINDLE AND THE PHOTOS AND ILLUSTRATIONS ARE JUST AS POOR AS  THE FIRST."
"749","I wish it had a light for reading at night. Other than that its what I was looking for."
"750","I was disappointed that it did not have a lighted screen and that I paid for this Kindle not knowing that I got the cheaper price because it allows for advertising by Amazon which I do not appreciate."
"751","I think it is very cheaply made.  If I\I had know how bad it was  would have upgraded."
"752","Frustrated that the backlighting cannot be adjusted like all the other features though"
"753","There is no light for reading in bed. I assumed there would be one. Can I exchange it?"
"754","The screen locked up and I had to return it.  When I reorder I think I will upgrade."
"755","It has a smaller screen than I would like, would have preferred to get my Kindle Keyboard fixed.  It meets my needs since I needed something I could use outside, which I can't do with my Kindle Fire.  I really don't think that Amazon should charge more for purchasing one without ""special offers"" (aka ADS). It would also be nice if the covers were reusable.  Really, how hard would it be to make this and the other Kindles to fit in the original covers? I ended up retrofitting my old cover with Velcro...  But it does what it's supposed to do very well."
"756","I absolutely LOVE IT, I'm a voracious  reader, never get enough!  It's great fun to stock it with the books I love and it also frees up my iPad for other fun things to do!  It's small enough to be comfortable for reading in bed, more comfortable than even a book. I can take it with me as it fits in my bag and it holds a charge for so long!  I still love my paper  books but this is a wonderful addition to my library.  The world is mine, I can go anywhere with the written word and do it all from the comfort of my home!"
"757","This is my 5th kindle. The product keeps getting better. At this price I think I will start buying them as gifts.Best feature: not having a browser or other electronic distraction! You can actually use it to read a book.Other favorite features: Great readable screen. Fast page turns. Lots of customization of reading experience."
"758","I swore I'd never use an e-reader, but I've crossed the line! I've had my Kindle for one day and I've downloaded 2 books. Really enjoying it. I'll never give up my actual books, but this is so convenient for when I'm in a hurry for a good read, I don't have to wait for a delivery, I don't have to run to the store or library. Also, I can download library books to the Kindle! When they are due back, they just disappear from the device. Love it! The screen is glare free and very comfortable to read and operate. I didn't get the Kindle with the back-light because I figure my actual books don't come with a light and since this was my first reader I didn't want to pay more. If I ever upgrade, I can give this one to my grand daughter."
"759","My old reader died a horrible death and I shopped around for a good deal and I certainly got one. I like being able to get my books through Amazon as I trust them and this reader has lived up to what I read about it. And, I've found books that I haven't seen in years that are available. I'm still learning about the reader but enjoying it very much."
"760","I am very pleased with my new Kindle but am stymied as to how to delete books that I have read from the Kindle.  I do not have a problem swiping to turn pages.  It is easy to read.  I also like it that I can change the size of the font if need be.  The only problem is not being able to figure out how to delete from the Kindle."
"761","This has been a most unexpected and pleasurable item to use. My kids purchased it as a gift for me. I am an avid book lover and never thought I would enjoy an electronic book. I was wrong. It has been a wonderful gift & I use it every day. It is also very simple & user friendly, which is good for someone born before the computer era. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves to read. Furthermore, it is much easier to carry around with me than a regular book. Please note a simple piece of advice though; Always keep at least a few books on the devise. I made the mistake of only having 1 book on it while out of Wi-Fi range when I completed that 1 book and could not download another until getting back into range of a Wi-Fi signal. I now keep at least 3-5 books on the device at all times."
"762","This the most fantastic device I have every purchased from Amazon. As I get older, my eyes are not what they used to be and, although I am an avid reader, and while I used to base my book selection on author and book title,  I find myself gravitating toward books with larger type. With this, and its adjustable type, I can read like I was young again. I absolutely love it. My only complaints are that (a) the 110 volt charging cord should have been included with it, and (b) the leather case is a ripoff and not worth nearly the price. But, again, as to the Kindle itself, it is better than watermelons, sliced bread, and sex. What can I say?"
"763","I have Kindle Fire, which I dearly love; however cannot read it in the sunlight.  So, I bought the e-reader specifically because I am going on a beach vacation and want to read while I am away.  This is not my first e-reader (this is my third the first two having gone to Kindle heaven) so I know that it is perfect for vacation reading:  it is light weight, holds more than enough books and best of all I CAN READ IT IN THE SUN because it is glare-free."
"764","Good choice because the screen is not backlit so it doesn't keep you from getting to sleep."
"765","Did not like it, thought I was getting the paper white version, so I am returning this one."
"766","The Kindle is a piece of crap. It jams up and  goes to the same two screens over and over."
"767","Blurry main page couldn't read hardly anything and it was important to use sending it back"
"768","It was very hard for me to read it, however, I am getting used to it. Should have researched it more."
"769","Happy with everything it has to offer except it does not work with a cover that has a light in it."
"770","no instructions with item and no anything to help with understanding the tablet. very difficult !"
"771","I like to read my kKndle while I am hunting deer.  After reading in a misty drizzle of rain my earlier version of Kindle died. After arriving back home I immediately ordered a new Kindle for my reading pleasure. I chose this version because it didn't have a back light which kills the battery faster. It was also similar to my previous version. So far I like it very much. The only reason I gave it a four star rating is because I now will have to use special gloves while reading while I am hunting or I will have to take my glove off every time I turn a page. I did enjoy the push button page turner while out in the woods with my gloves on."
"772","Its OK and and allows me to read outdoors which I could not do on the IPAD. However, its time that the the PaperWhite technology be the standard even in the base model. For the price I paid under the special I got value. However, without the deal, this device is no bargain."
"773","Got this for my mom for xmass. She didn't like how the screen was so dark and no light provided."
"774","This entry-level Kindle is just what I was looking for: something inexpensive to read in bright sunlight with.  Does the job without breaking the bank on yet ANOTHER muti-hundred dollar electronic device.  You need a booklight to use it in low or no light though."
"775","Replaced my first Kendall with this one, wi fi on this unit not as strong as my first generation"
"776","My kindle broke the day after I got it......still waiting for customer service to call me......"
"777","Loved my other two, this is a poor example, no backlight, no color, I'm going to send it back!"
"778","I returned it as it not have a light & I had a Kindle fire before & it wasn't at all like it."
"779","I might be a little biased because mine was broken. It never would charge properly. It was constantly dying. But also I realized, it not having a back lit screen was a huge issue for me! Just all around hated it. But the return was really easy. So that's good!"
"780","If you do not want lit screen go for this instead for the higher resolution one. I bought the higher resolution and own both of them. There is not much difference in the quality of the text in real life."
"781","I bought this because I cracked the screen on my previous kindle (my fault).  I was surprised that this new model was heavier and bulkier than my older kindle from years back.  I suppose it's to squeeze in the touch technology.  The touch technology is not bad. Though, I do miss the lighter and thinner kindle I used to own. But, otherwise, I use my kindle a lot and I like it."
"782","This is a pretty cool little device. I think the Kindle books are way too expensive considering what I'm giving up (having the physical book on my bookshelf and flipping the pages), but there are enough free books that it makes it worth more; plus, the ability to read PDFs is very useful. As a musician, this will come in handy in the future. Now if I can convince my wife to hand it over..."
"783","very lightweight, small, easy to read. I wish it was backlit, so I could read in the dark. Other than that, it is everything I could ask for. One thing I wish amazon/kindle would, is to allow you to  move all of the books you have on one device, to another, with one move.It was tedious to have to move all of my book from my old kindle, one at a time, to my new kindle. Just a thought."
"784","No way to make it bright, way too small, just pointless, will be sending this back, not at all impressed."
"785","The package came I n crushed and the sheet inside was destroyed.  Don't think I would order another one."
"786","My first Kindle. I simply love it! Even without a back light it's completely glare free and I'm enjoying every page of every book I read! Now my daughter is wanting one and can't for Christmas because this is going to be onee of her gifts."
"787","was disappointed as thought it had built in light but it did not.....couldn't see it very  well at all."
"788","Connects to the internet great though you can not use it to browse the internet, only Amazon for books. Some times it skips a page when progressed so it's something to watch out for. It downloads books effortlessly and doesn't keep you from using the kindle as it is downloading. It is very easy to read from and it really does look like paper. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the higher models but I don't think they are necessary. I almost bought the next model up but it was so much more expensive and I only wanted that one because it comes with free 3g internet and I don't have good access to internet right now. All in all I think this base model is a great value and I would recommend it to anyone."
"789","Beware ""Fading Screen"" issue. You won't find much about it here on Amazon USA, but I found a little about it on Amazon UK. There is an issue with ""fading screens"". The screen scripts sometimes begin to fade when the battery runs low and signals low battery. I don't use  my kindle as much as others but the battery runs low quickly with the onscreen advertisements. I bought 7th Generation Kindle to take with me overseas. last week the battery ran low - I recharged it and noted that the script at the bottom of the screen appeared a little fuzzy. Then each day the ""fading"" expands more so that now the bottom half of the screen is unreadable. And of course the warranty has expired. No more Kindles for me!"
"790","My mistake but when purchasing this item for my wife I neglected to note that it didn't light up as mine does."
"791","My Grand daughter loves her Kindle. I love mine as well which is why we bought the second one from Amazon who give the best products and the best prices and the best shipping. This Kindle meets her every need book lover that she is. No longer does she have to haul around a huge book bag of books."
"792","My old kindle with the side buttons broke , so I bought this one. I absolutely hate it, and will be sending it back. Maybe its just me , but I don't like the touch screen. I found it difficult and confusing. Also I had a page freeze on me. Unfroze an hour later. I just wanted to buy a basic Kindle so I can read books. I guess they don't make it anymore."
"793","Kindle is great if you don't mind paying for a new one every other year. I rarely used mine and half the screen has frozen. Since it is out of warranty Amazon refuses to back up the product. Save your money and check out other options. I won't be buying another Kindle."
"794","I had some problems with this kindle as described on my previous review copied bellow, but the excellent Amazon customer service promptly contacted me and proposed me a solution, which was updating the kindle software, or replacing the device as last resource. I have been using this kindle for a few days after the update and now it works like a charm. I am giving 4 starts to this kindle, and 6 stars for the excellent customer service.If you don't care about having an integrated service with Goodreads, I would still recommend the previous kindle 4th generation because is thinner, lighter, and aesthetically more beautiful. Nevertheless being able to access Goodreads on your kindle is perfect, and if you care about that I would definitely recommend this Kindle 6"" Touchscreen.-----------------------------------------I was reluctant to upgrade my old kindle because it worked great for me. However the integration with Goodreads was something that I wanted and since it is unlikely that Amazon will release a firmware upgrade for old kindles, I decided to give this new model a chance. I have to say that I am frustrated with my decision, and I still read most of my ebook on my good old kindle.Cons:- Sometimes the touch screen stays active for few seconds even after kindle is put to sleep. Because of that my books are frequently in different pages when I turn back on, and it is a pain to find back the right page.- When I am reading in the airplane mode to save some battery, errors appears in the middle of the reading saying that it couldn't find network connection. I have to turn some pages back and forth to make the message disappear and when it does, sometimes it skips randomly a few pages or a whole chapter and it is again a pain to find back the right page.- The touch screen was not designed for left handed people.- The software that runs on this kindle feels like horrible.Pros:- Integrated with Goodreads.The previous kindle fourth generation is simpler but very well designed. This new one sounds cool in theory, but they did a nice job in ruining the reading experience, besides making the device thicker, heavier, and less attractive aesthetically speaking."
"795","When I orderd it I did not know you have 2 sizes. Disappointed that I got the 6 inch scream. I am still trying it."
"796","would like the screen to have some back light or something  can't read unless i have a light right on the kindle."
"797","I took it back and exchanged is for one that has a light to read at night."
"798","I wish it were lighted after all. The bookmark drops down and covers some of the words. I don't like that part."
"799","I could barely read the words on the screen which was very disappointing. I paid for a kindle that I can't use."
"800","I was disappointed in the product.  I thought I was getting a Kindle Fire which I bought on my previous order."
"801","This is noticeably cheaper feeling that the metallic Kindle I had previously, but it doesn't really matter. The e-ink display is very sharp and makes reading much more of a pleasure than on a backlit display. Huge battery life makes this an obvious replacement for a pile of books on your next vacation."
"802","Great price for a perfectly sized reading device.  Very lightweight, so I wonder about durability.  Given the price, not a big worry.  I wished the screen was a brighter white.  I bought this as battery life is so much better than an iPad!"
"803","Cutest eReader I've owned yet, and lightest. Comfy to hold and slips easily into most purse sizes. I've owned a Sony 505, a basic Nook, a Kindle Fire. Neither of those readers have been this light.If you don't need to read in the dark, like to carry your reader everywhere you go, and don't need any extras like an MP3 player, then this should do you just fine. Has a nice crisp screen and fast response time. I have only ever charged this device once since I bought it... Four weeks later, and it is still going. I read about an hour a day. For a no frills reader, this is great value."
"804","It's a great way to store books. Not being a lit screen is more natural.Once in a while it jumps many pages when I just want to turn a page.It's probably too complicated to be able to s at exactly what page you're on but it would be nice."
"805","This product has very limited features.The screen truly is glare free and this is very light when holding."
"806","The lack of buttons in favor of a touch-screen system that isn't very user friendly was a big drawback for this model."
"807","Need to send this back it did work from the time I took it out of the box. Another lauguange unable to translates m"
"808","There is no information saying that it does NOT have a back-light so you can;t read it in the dark--ie at bedtime."
"809","This is my third (and smallest) tablet/reader.Initially less than impressed.Reading was OK'ish, but less enjoyable than expected.Decided to keep it and a couple of weeks later my opinion came up slightly,but NOT to five stars.Contrast and font are adjustable (size and character set), andI can read this anywhere I can read a paper printed book.It's an evolving product, and will get better.Just wondering about the battery's life expectancy.I'm guessing it's throwaway when the battery no longer holds a good charge.Anyone know?"
"810","I love the look, the size, the weight.  The toolbar is versatile and allows the reader to get anywhere and do practically anything instantly. When I need a definition, I just touch the word itself and hold until the dictionary entry appears.  This Kindle also lets you decide how much reading assistance you get so it's a great reader for children and adults. The only thing that isn't perfect is the swipe page-turn. It's very sensitive and once in a while it skips ahead --- whoa!  Other than that, it's great."
"811","It's a fine reader, bit my elderly mother could not master the options on the touch screen. She has an older reader with the hard keys on the device.The battery is tiring and I thought it would be nice to replace it with a nee one. No-go for the 88 year old."
"812","Good"
"813","Good"
"814","It may not show as verified purchase because my husband bought this for me on his amazon account for Christmas this year and I  love it! No hard glare because it doesn't have  the lit up screen but it is great in sunlight. Battery lasts longer then my other e- reader. Holds thousands of books and has never froze on me like other e-readers have!! Great buy for the price! If you want all the apps chose the Kindle fire, if you want a kindle for only reading this one is perfect!I like using the Goodreads connection available with this Kindle also!"
"815","I am really enjoying my kindle. Although I think all the novels and books are short stories, they are still good to read."
"816","to Amazon the kindle dosen;t have it on light  in other words Iam not happy with cover or  the kindleFommanny"
"817","I bought one, it does not have a backlight so the only place it really helps is out side full daylight. Only good because I use it in conjunction with my samsung smart phone which is much better than the kindle. My reco is upgrade to a better model, do yourself a favor save your money, this model is a waste."
"818","I got this kindle as a gift from a book event I went to and I love it. It's very light and small so it fits in my purse perfectly. I haven't charged it in a month and I use it on and off. So for me the battery is great. I highly recommend this kindle."
"819","I bought this for my father who is in the hospital after a serious issue. He was in there without his glasses and could not read anything in normal print. When this arrived I put some Louis L'Amour books on it for him and took down to him. He was able to read the screen without glasses and without having to blow the font all the way up. This came through exactly like I needed it to. Thank you, Amazon."
"820","Good Kindle, and knew what I was buying, but still find the lack of backlight more irritating than I thought I would.  I have a kindle paperwhite, and my husband snagged this one to replace his recently broken Kindle Touch.  We bought a case with a light, but there just arent enough products with a durable enough light to make this a worthwhile purchase anymore.  Glad we snagged this on sale!"
"821","This item definitely does what it says. It allows you to read books without carrying books with you. It isn't built to do anything else but it does that one thing really well.This version is the lowest tier of Kindle available. It has none of the bells and whistles, like 3G access to the internet or a backlight or a high definition screen. However, if you load on a bunch of books (and it will hold lots and lots of books), you don't need the 3G even when you can't find a wifi signal. It has it's own dictionary so you can still look up words even without wireless signal. It is light, and easy to hold, and the user interface feels very intuitive to me. Without a backlit screen you do need a decent light source to read, but then, so do books. The screen is clear and readable, and I appreciate being able to make the text different sizes.Yes, the screen savers on this device are advertisements. There are no ads while you are actually reading, and hey, you might find a new book or two that you would love, that you wouldn't have heard of otherwise. So far the ads seem pretty unobtrusive to me, but if you don't like them you can pay a fee and Amazon will turn them off for you, which seems reasonable, especially as it's only a one time fee, not an ongoing charge. My old 3rd gen Kindle has a finite number of screen savers and you can't change them, so this is at least different.Overall, for the price I paid, given that I can't afford the paperwhite or the voyager, this is a good reading device with a good screen that is easy to use but isn't full of the fun bells and whistles that come if you can invest more money into your electronics."
"822","I bought 2 of these for my grandkids for Christmas. They are exactly as described. The glare free screen makes it easy on their eyes and they can read in different lighting conditions which makes it great for reading in the car or in bed at night. The size is great too."
"823","Before this Kindle I hated reading. The page feeling of a book makes me cringe and the glare from light is awful on a regular book.  This kindle allows me to personalize my reading experience for myself.  It makes it so I can space the text how I want, make it bolder, change margins and tracks the percent and location I'm at in the book  making it more fun because I see my progress.  It's awesome and has driven me to start reading tons now! Best gift ever!!!"
"824","I bought the Kindle touch because my Kindle keyboard  screen no longer worked. I haven't had the touch long but so far I like it. I do miss the buttons that the other model had. I didn't want a touchscreen and find that the touch is sensitive and turns more than one page at a time. As far as the other options on this reader go I probably won't use them."
"825","good"
"826","Cool"
"827","I specifically purchased this ""bottom"" model in order to NOT have any background lighting and avoid the ""blue screen"" issues associated with sleep interference. (And I thought that something that did NOT have the distractions of FaceBook and Candy Crush would be more productive).  Ended up being pleased for so many more reasons!  Lightweight, compact, super easy to read and turn pages, along with an amazing battery life."
"828","It's a Kindle. It displays books, just like it is supposed to. Readable. No light (as expected). My cell phone charger plug works for it just fine, so no need to buy another. I bought this on the March '15 special for $59. I have an older Kindle Fire as well, but this is better for books. I'm not distracted by apps, the battery life is way longer and it is much lighter. The adverts are not too annoying (mostly books), and only show on the first screen before you swipe it to turn it on. Of course their proposed advert books are way off from my interest, but hey, that's Amazon. They'll figure it out one of these days. I bought a black leather-like cover (Elsse For Kindle 7th Gen) for about $9, and I don;t like screen protectors, so the whole kit was only $68. Satisfied customer."
"829","was very unhappy to see that its completely useless for reading in the dark at night>.>? one of the main reasons I got it!"
"830","Received one as a gift for my birthday from my kids. Quit working 18 days after warranty ended. Very expensive brick. DO NOT buy."
"831","I like it but  I never got the cover I order for it could u check in to that it on my card so I would like to have it soon please"
"832","I don't like it don't wo property the settings don't work I can't buy any books I can't connect to a wifi I'm very disappointed"
"833","I keep losing the book I am reading and can't retrieve it.  Written instructions should be sent rather than put on the screen."
"834","Not like my original kindle- I am not the type that like all the touch features. I like a kindle that has features displayed on the frame and easy to see features. All this slide technique is trying to copy an iPhone which if I wanted I would get an IPad"
"835","So I had an earlier version and love kindles. This one doesn't have buttons which I kinda miss, but the touch screen works pretty well. I like that they changed the way it's made, the screen is the same size but it's a little thicker and a lot more compact so it fits in small bags and large pockets better. Haven't figured out how to make collections on this one yet, but I haven't spent a lot of time trying so there is probably a way."
"836","I loved my old kindle. This one is thick and heavy in comparison. The touch screen is too sensitive. It gets to busy doing things that I don't like to have happening (e.g. it keeps changing fonts or opens a dictionary when I accidentally touch the screen. I miss the page turning buttons on the side. With this one you have to move your hand from where you are holding the kindle in order to swipe the screen."
"837","I know that this might sound weird for some people but Kindle Glare Free works BETTER for me than paperwhite ! I was recently gifted with this Kindle and I love it more than my old paperwhite , mainly because of the light gray pages and the absence of the screen light (which tired my eyes after long hours of reading)"
"838","I must be a dumb senior citizen to purchase this without any instructions in the box.  It keeps turning off on me though it is charged."
"839","Could not even read it was so dark.  I didn't know it was dark and did not want to use a light... completely useless for my needs."
"840","This is great for novels, but I read a lot of nonfiction with pictures, maps and diagrams which are difficult to visualize the details.  I would recommend this for any book that does not contain visual aids because they don't in this format  I still haven't worked out all the manipulations of the device yet which can be sometimes frustrating when one finds oneself going in circles, but, given time, I expect to figure it all out.  Again, great for fiction, not so good for maps and diagrams. And  it saves space not needed for a collection of many huge bookcases.  ."
"841","This was surprisingly easy to navigate. And as one review pointed out the touchscreen is highly responsive. Setting up collections was a bit tricky so you may want to create those first (if you don't have them already) before downloading your archived items on your device. I wasn't too thrilled with the experimental web browser at first, but it too is fairly easy to manage/navigate, once you get used to it. I love it."
"842","Bought to use for just ebook reading, mainly Kindle Books. Was using HDX 7"". Because of battery usage of HDX I had to charge a lot. I will mainly use for reading in restaurants, doctors, while waiting for planes. I mainly keep in my car when traveling in a Amazon Basics zip pouch. Battery will last weeks. I purchased at very low price ($50) or would have gotten paperwhite if bought direct. Touch works fine, found a cheap portrait case for it because screen doesn't rotate, strictly vertical portrait."
"843","I ordered this for my grandmother it's a wonderful device. My only problem is it does not come with written instructions. I understand it has instructions loaded on it, however for older generation that are not tech savvy it would be helpful to have a print manual. Once she gets the hang of it I'm sure she will love it."
"844","I liked my old one better, the one that lights. The case that was sold to my wife didn't fit. Has been returned I am just going to use my  I pad"
"845","Great product, only problem is if I want to read in bed at night I need to keep the light on as there is no back light to read in the dark."
"846","over 'teched ,that back and forth cloud crap is creepy,does any body really know how the the ''clouds''work and it takes too long to come on then i get a box with indecipherable questions in it,and you should supply some sort of dictionary/glossary on meanings"
"847","I thought this would be a nice change. Nothing but books and nothing else. I have another Kindle bigger and full of stuff besides books and I get caught up in Redditch and FB. Well this little guy fits the bill. I wasn't use to the lack of colour, but, I'm only reading! It's a responsive little guy. And the screen size doesn't hurt my feelings. It's just right."
"848","Am so happy with my Kindle.  I have the HD Fire but I cannot read it outside.  So I got this on the July Black Friday for a great price.  Am so glad.  I only wish that it had the capability to ""read"" to me as does the HD Fire for those times I want to do something else while ""reading"".Very happy with it and how it syncs across all my devices."
"849","After having the first generation, what a difference in the visual quality. It is clear and easy to read in all lighting andmakes reading much easier when you are not squinting all the time. A great value and perfect for the avid reader"
"850","This is my 3rd Kindle. The first two were very good. This one is very difficult to use and I hate it.  It is time to investigate other manufacturers."
"851","It doesn't do much. I was surprised it had no other downloads but books. Also the cover didn't fit & I returned it. Really not happy about it at all."
"852","Can not download books directly to device from the library, must go through computer. This is crazy! I want library use to be easy, not complicated."
"853","Tvery disappointed the page is not bright enough to read at night without buying a light to show honor which of course is separate it doesn't come with the cover I bought I'm just disappointed in the whole thing"
"854","I wish I ordered add free version. at first i did not understand it and for the price I ordered now it is getting very annoying with amazon adds."
"855","Really, Amazon?  You took away the battery connection?  REALLY?!!  I'd really like to smack someone upside the head with this thing. My kindle keyboard 3G just kicked up it's tiny heels and died. So I ordered the new touch- the ONLY not backlit one of the new batch- and a lighted case. Except the lighted case is for the 'old' kindle touch and not the 'new' kindle touch, because some genius decided to not include the connection pads on the new one. I don't like reading on a backlit screen, especially at night. It strains my eyes. I'm pretty sure there are eleventy billion other people who feel the same way. I'm sure, at some point, a third-party manufacturer will come up with a working lighted case with it's own power source. I'm pissed that it's completely unnecessary and kind of a jerk move. You're getting too big for your britches, Amazon. Maybe you should reconsider putting the screws to your customers before they ALL jump ship for B&N."
"856","I recently purchased this kindle with the intention of ""testing it out"" and returning it if it didn't meet my expectations. After using it for over a month, however, it's definitely become a keeper.One of the first things I noticed was how much faster it was compared to my previously owned Kindle Keyboard. I'm talking about both the speediness of the device itself and overall usability; typing text and selecting things both feel faster on the touchscreen interface than using the Kindle Keyboard's physical keys. In addition, because everything is done through the screen, I can usually touch the spot where I want to move the cursor instead of having to scroll to the location. The pages turn noticeably more quickly on this model than the Kindle Keyboard I had. Another thing I like is the feel of the device. This kindle is a little thicker than its keyboard predecessor, but it's also shorter, meaning holding it is even more similar to holding a small paperback book. This, combined with the nicely sized touchscreen and some of the touch gestures, makes one-handed navigation even easier. My only criticism is that the screen sometimes seems a little more sensitive than expected, causing unintentional page turns. This doesn't occur very frequently, however, and may be more due to me still getting used to the change in interacting with the device. Regardless, this can be alleviated by using a stylus, and the screen overall is well calibrated in my experience.As for the new features like Vocabulary Builder and integration with Goodreads, I don't currently use those much. However, I can see how they'd be useful especially in the case of studying and trying to get through difficult material, or if you had kids and wanted to encourage them to read more without having to buy a separate device. And if you never end up needing them, it isn't ridiculously hard to either ignore them or turn them off in the system settings.Overall, this was a very good purchase. Compared to the Kindle Keyboard, this model is faster and more comfortable to use. The extra features don't weigh it down, and the new design makes the reader less aware of the hardware and more aware of what's being read."
"857","I got this as an anniversary gift and I love it. I have loads of books on it and it is super easy to use. I also love how portable it is--I can slip this into my purse for silent reading time at work (I work in a school) and have all my books right there. I definitely will be using this for some summer reading!"
"858","I love my new Kindle! It's easy to read with less eyestrain than a tablet or laptop. It has wifi for quick shopping and download. It is VERY easy and intuitive to use and has very useful dictionary, hi lighting and bookmark features.It's small, yet functional and has an amazing battery life.To me, it's the ultimate reader."
"859","Been using a tablet for ebooks, but the display was basically unuseable outside in the sun where I spend alot of time reading.  The Kindle is amazing in bright sunlite and exceeds my expectations for readability outside.  Only wish it would support openlibrary.org."
"860","great"
"861","Worst product I have ever dealt with by far!!! BEWARE. Originally Wi-fi worked fine and had no issue getting books...than after a month or so could not connect to any of the 15 Wi-fi configurations I had tried along with hours of troubleshooting still simply said it could not connect. Ended up smashing it off the balcony... it seems as if they Wi-fi adapter just fried or something. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH"
"862","Everything workswell with this Kindle, but I wish I had my last one with back-light.  I don't like having to read it only when the room lighting allows."
"863","I ordered this reader because all i needed was a simple one. when i got it, i couldn't read anything because the background was GRAY, not white, and it was illegible. when i called customer service they seemed to think that was normal. if that's normal, no one would buy this. it was an eye-strain to look at it, and no settings whatsoever for brightness or anything. i still don't know if it was defective or just meant for people who like to read dark pages."
"864","This was a Christmas gift so I could read before turning out the lights and going to bed. [New research shows the blue light in tablet and computer screens interferes with sleep cycles.] It's very lightweight making it easy to hold and I have enjoyed reading on it, especially the embedded dictionary/Wiki function.Somewhat critical comments: Page turning function 'hangs-up' at times, which is annoying and it is slightly too dark a page for me unless I have a bright reading light on... might be my age (mid-60's), who knows? Overall, I have enjoyed reading on the Kindle."
"865","First Kindle device. Had a minor glitch registering my new Kindle Touch, but Amazon Help pleasantly and competently guided me through a reset and subsequent setup. Was surprised how tethered to Amazon.com the device is configured, requiring Amazon involvement even in acquisition of library loaned literature.  Love the contrast of the text on the screen and how it improves my experience reading on an electronic display. Once I figured out where to tap on the screen to maneuver through books and menu selections, I liked it. Looking forward to expanding literary horizons now that I have so many options at my fingertips with my new Kindle."
"866","I play Scrabble with my Kindle, along with a lot of reading. My old Kindle failed, so I replaced it with this ""updated"" touch screen unit. It is not compatible with Scrabble, and won't even download it from online. Big disappointment, and unless you are very careful, there is no way to know ahead of time. If you play Scrabble, do not buy this unit. I returned it the day after I received it and ordered the more expensive Paper White, which is compatible with Scrabble."
"867","The devise was very good, once I learned to navigate it. Not being a nerd in electronics I usually have a few problems learning to get through the operations of such.  All in all I was pleased with the reader, so Thanks much."
"868","happy"
"869","Great"
"870","I recently purchased the Amazon Kindle with a 6” touch-screen and Wi-Fi capabilities. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is a book lover or traveler. There are several features of the Kindle that I enjoy; the glare-free screen, quick download times, battery life, and tools available while reading.The Kindle’s glare-free screen is great for reading outside on sunny days. Unlike the iPad, you don’t need to worry about a glare coming off the screen making it hard to read. However, should you want to used an iPad, all of your books are available using the Kindle app. Reading from the tablet instead of a book is also nice to have for beach reading. There is nothing worse than a book full of sand!I was shocked when my books downloaded so fast. They downloaded just as quickly any app would download on your phone. I found this very impressive considering how many GBs of space is used to download books to a device. The quick download speed really comes in handy if you are at an airport and want to buy a book before a flight. Keep in mind the Kindle has Wi-Fi access, not 3G. This means you must be in a location with Wi-Fi to purchase and download books.Nothing is more frustrating than needing to constantly be charging your electronic devices. You should be able to go a few days without needing to charge your Kindle. This depends, of course, on how much you use it during the day. When you travel, you may need to charge it more frequently than when you do not because you will be reading on it more. This is one of my favorite features as I find myself charging my iPhone and iPad at least once a day even when I’m not using them much throughout the day.Finally, there are some very helpful tools that can be used while reading. I find the dictionary to be very useful. Whenever you come across a word that you do not know, you can highlight it and look it up right then. Along with this, there is a highlighting tool. You can highlight passages in the book you are reading and what other readers highlighted as well.I give this product 5 stars and I hope my fellow book lovers find this product as great as I do!"
"871","Good e-reader. Better than expected. There is no glare in most situations, but there is a glare when the screen is angled toward the light source, which is irritating. I'd recommend it for folks that don't want the backlit screen."
"872","In my location it was hard to connect to WIFI sometimes.  With the new Kindle it is so quick and easy to get books.  Have loved having a Kindle since my family gave me one as a gift after they first came out.  The glare free screen helps when outside."
"873","Exactly what I wanted.  I already have a Kindle Fire HD but wanted something lighter to carry to work and wanted glare free for outdoor reading. This is perfect and the price was good too (got on sale for $57).Bought Nov 2014 - now Mar 2016 and it just stopped working.  I do not use it every day.  Still have paperbacks I read and on trips I take my Kindle Fire for games/internet/books.  So I am a little disappointed that this stopped working a little over a year into lighter usage than my Kindle Fire."
"874","I am disappointed In the contrast.  I feel it is a little hard to read without extra light around you indooors.  Also, I did not realize it was black and white only."
"875","I am the same way! I don't like the new kindle!! Bring back the old version! Yes, it is possible you did not improve on the device!  I don't like touch screens......"
"876","I am extremely disappointed with the ads on the device.  It was not obvious that this was part of the purchase and I bought 4 - my kids are also extremely frustrated!!!!  How much money do you need to make on the sale of these devices!!!"
"877","My rating is heavily influenced by my expectation that this would be a step up from my Kindle Keyboard (which died at 5 years of age). The new Kindle is not as comfortable in the hand, I just don't love the touch screen, and it is ONLY for reading. I actually find the touch screen kind of annoying (personal preference). Also on the negative side (and a warning to other buyers), if you enjoy Active Content - you won't be able to use it on this device. I played ""Every Word"" pretty much every day on my Kindle Keyboard. Received a Paperwhite as a gift and discovered Active Content is not compatible. After a lengthy phone call and being assured by an Amazon ""Kindle Expert"" that I could play the game on this model, I exchanged the Paperwhite. Active Content is NOT compatible with this model - I don't know why their ""expert"" assured me it was. It's another annoyance and it seems kind of stupid that Amazon would take away the ability to use their own material. The only way you can use active content now is on certain Kindle models only available through third-party sellers. On the plus side the screen is easy to read for anyone who has eye issues with back-lit devices. This is a nice, non-glare reading experience. There are different fonts and sizes to choose from. This is the first time I have been so seriously disappointed with a buying experience from Amazon, and it's really left a bad impression. The Paperwhite was given as a thoughtful gift to replace my beloved Keyboard; however, the gift giver wanted me to be able to play my game AND read, so encouraged me to call to arrange an exchange for one that would do what I wanted. I made the decision to replace it with this model on the advice of an expert who apparently wasn't, I was disappointed again. So, all in all, if you only want to read, and can't take LED or backlit screens, this is an OK tool for those purposes. As a PS: Why was the Keyboard eliminated (some people liked it)? Repair services would have been a great option, also. I'm sure there are others out there who don't feel the newer models are all an improvement."
"878","I have had 2 other Kindles prior to this one.  No there was nothing wrong with them, I still have one of them and gave the other to a friend that didn't have one.  I love the touch screen.  My only regret (and this is on me not on Kindle) I think I should have got the paper white.  Recently traveling with some friends wanting to read in a hotel room after they went to bed I was wishing I had the back light.  I guess I will just have to purchase a new book light.  I love love love this kindle."
"879","Light and handy but not readable in low light"
"880","I can't read at night. Upset because the week after I purchased this one, they placed the Kindle Paperwhite at a lower price. Would have preferred to have that offer earlier."
"881","I was disappointed with my purchase...but it was my own fault.  I returned it and ordered a Kindle Paper White, which is what I wanted in the first place!!!  Duh! I really didn't like it because it was not really readable.  I much prefer my Kindle Fire to it.  But I'm perfectly happy with my new Paper White, Thank you!"
"882","I would love it if it had a backlight.  When I bought it, I was unaware there was no backlight, otherwise, I may have bought another product.  It is easy to use and compact."
"883","I love this kindle: it is my first one. I like the glare free screen. It works as advertised in the sun. I love highlighting and taking notes, as well as looking up words in the dictionary. I dislike that I cannot read on it without an external light- I wish it had a setting to allow me to turn on a light so I could see it while lying in bed or on a plane. Finally, I wonder what will happen to my notes and highlighting of non-fiction text if this kindle dies. Is there a way to save them?"
"884","I bought this on a whim.  I have an iPad that I have always used to read books on.  I started having wrist and arm pain, and I traced it back to holding the iPad for hours.  It seems silly, but I just got annoyed with the weight of it.  So I bought the Kindle, fell in love, and we've been happily ever after since.  It's lightweight, no glare, and I can read outside in the bright light (love that feature).  I haven't quite figured out how to find books online and get them using only the Kindle. I usually find them on my computer, then download on the kindle.  It's how I've always done it, so no problem there.  It didn't take me longer than 10 minutes to figure out how to set it up, use it, and download my books on my Kindle account.  My kids still can't believe I'm cheating on Apple, but I love this little thing."
"885","I will have to say, I like this better than the paperwhite. The light of the Paperwhite burned my eyes and I couldn't read more than 10 pages at a time. This product's display actually feels like a real book. Now I can read for hours"
"886","I like it yet there are no instructions except in it, which is a problem if you miss them.  I wish they weren't completely touch.  Not everyone likes or can use touch.  My girlfriend is Physically Disabled and can use hers with the buttons.  I hope it never breaks.  She can't use touch. I was happy with the price deal when I bought it. Cool device over all.  Will they ever make them bigger tho?"
"887","The product is great, the only problem it does not have ilumination, so reading on aplane is impossible. My old model had a lamp incorporated into the cover - simple and effective"
"888","Got a headache while setting it up. Does not have light. It's black ink on gray screen. Exchanging it for the (unfortunately) more expensive Paperwhite, which has light settings."
"889","It's so different from my original kindle, I still have much to learn.  How do I delete an expired library book from the kindle?  I would appreciate hearing from you.  Thank you."
"890","This is the 2nd Kindle I bought.  The first one was a couple of years ago and about the same price.  I like the older one better.  The new one seems ok until you compare it to the older version.  Maybe I should have bought the one with the light but the older one was not marketed as lighting up.  I will keep but don't be fooled by the term ""paper white"" because it is sort of grey."
"891","Amazon you have to do better.  Navigation is not intuitive and pages don't go forward and backwards trouble free.  Not worth the price and Amazon is better off giving it away as a free gift than charging money for it."
"892","Excellent product: it's small, multi functional, but simple.  The glare free aspect sold itself, and although I've always enjoyed reading in the past, I have increased my reading by more than 50% because of its convenience, font selections, and ease of use.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy reading from something that's just right and without paying a ridiculous amount of money for all of the extra ""stuff"" (which would be a distraction anyway)."
"893","love it.  portable, light.  long-lasting battery.  glare free screen.  affordable price (got mine on a lightning deal for $50)does not have a backlight...which I thought would be a hassle, but so far, it really hasn't impacted me at all.  I never use the little clip on light I got to go with it in fact."
"894","I think it is unfortunate that Amazon wants to squeeze extra money from the consumer to eliminate commercial advertisement. I am increasingly more dissatisfied with Amazon as time goes by."
"895","I had an old Kindle and thought it was time for an upgrade. I was not impressed. The newer version  seems cheap - like a child's toy. I an returning it and will keep using my old Kindle."
"896","I did not like Kindle 6"" glare-free for two reasons, 1. I was not able to rotate the the pdf I uploaded, can't increase the font size. 2. in day time cloudy weather, I was not able to read the book at full brightness."
"897","Will not connect to Kindle store.  After 30 minutes with tech support they said they would try to fix software problem in three to five days.  Why not just send a new new one overnight?"
"898","Was somewhat disappointed... the good news is that the screen is a good size for reading and it is very light to hold. However, the screen is rather dark for reading (even in sunlight) and the only adjustment available is the background color (doesn't help). They have also placed the power button on the bottom of the Kindle AGAIN; the book keeps turning itself off when I hold it in one hand (which is supposed to be the point of it being lightweight).This particular issue is the most annoying."
"899","the only problem I have with the new kindle is the choices of font sizes.  I had a kindle keyboard that broke which is why I purchased the new kindle. the font sizes jump from barely big enough for me to see with my bi-focules to HUGE. a step in between sizes 6 & 7 would be perfect.  otherwise everything is easy to navigate."
"900","Love the new 7th generation Kindle e-reader.  Already own the older, button operated one & enjoy that one as well. If you want or need a tablet the Fire will work just fine for you, but if reading is your primary usage nothing beats the Kindle e-reader.  Easy control of font size makes it very adaptable to each individual.  The non-glare screen really does work.  I've read a lot from people who have an issue with the touch screen--I don't.  Very easy to use & user friendly.  No, it's not designed for color printed graphic novels or comic books but for reading books it's great.  A definite addition if you travel or fly a lot--just download the books before you go & read away."
"901","I love to read and I have resisted going to an e-reader as I am old fashioned and like to hold a book.  As the cost of buying even paperbacks has risen so high, I cannot afford to pay for my ""habit"".  I tried my daughter-in-laws Kindle and found I could handle laying in bed to read as I often do.  In addition my local library carries a few thousand books for Kindle that are free just like checking out a book!!  I just got it for Christmas so I haven't tested all the possibilites but I am really please so far."
"902","I love my Kindle.  I only gave it a 4 stars because I am having difficulties learning to use it.  This is my first touch screen.  I can't seem to find the books loaded on my Kindle.  If I get off the book I am reading and go into some other book, I can get back to the first one.  But again, that is probably just me.  I really really loved my original Kindle purchased in 2010, and I really love this one.  Hopefully I will learn to use it.  Oh, and the learners program just doesn't cut it for me."
"903","A fabulous starter for our child! I'm wishing now that we got one that lights up but that has nothing to do with the product itself! We would totally make this purchase again but would upgrade!"
"904","5 star"
"905","The first one I was sent had a touchscreen issue so they replaced it immediately. I have fallen completely in love with my Kindle Touch, $79 base model. The ads are based on the books in my Kindle library and I find them a brilliant way to pick my next read. They are also only on the first page of the homepage in cover-view so they are incredible unobtrusive! I'm infatuated and cannot praise this product highly enough."
"906","I found there were lots of books that I wanted but I couldn't get through inter-library loan and the actual books were much more expensive.  I have found a number of great self-published authors for cheap or free.  The only thing I don't love is that background is gray and I wonder if it would have been worth it to buy the paperwhite as the background appears to be more like paper."
"907","I don't have wifi, I expected to download e books to my computer and transfer them to the kindle, but the process was much more complex than I expected and it took about 2 hours of live chat and two chat-live experts to finally accomplish it. The Chat line helped because the second person was an expert in Kindle and I was able to ask the person for clearer explanations.I hope the 2nd half of the transcript from that whole chat will help me to repeat the process the next time I want to download a book!!!"
"908","This is a great basic Kindle. It will allow you to read all of your favorite books (even at the beach in glare) in a small easy to travel with package. Kindle is the best E-reader on the market for a reason, and it continues to be the best."
"909","NOT SURE WHAT I THINK.  SINCE I'M COMPUTER ILLITERATE, THESE THINGS TAKE ME A WHILE TO LEARN MY WAY AROUND THEM.  HAVE ONLY HAD THIS NEW ONE 3 DAYS AND AM HAVING PROBLEMS FINDING MY WAY AROUND.  ALL I WANT IT FOR IS TO READ BOOKS.  DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A CLOUD.  I'M CONFUSED.  IT READS FINE ONCE I GET MY BOOK LOADED."
"910","Can not start it.  I do know the langard you use to use it. You sent no instrustion . Sorry I ever ordered it. I keep telling you this. But send nothing here  No mail or e-mail.  You know how to sent."
"911","I could not get it to recharge. Very disappointed and I just put it in the trash as I feel like that was what it was. What little time it worked I enjoyed. Just felt liked I wasted my money !!!!!!!"
"912","I cannot figure out if I can brighten the screen so I have to have my lamp on to read at night.  The book did not mention if it could be lightened. I should haveordered another Kindle Fire."
"913","Friends got me this for Christmas. They felt it time for me to move into the 21st century. I was a bit hesitant at first. When you've been reading real books as long as I have you wonder how a little etch a sketch wannabe could take the place of an actual paper book. Well I've had time to do some reading on it and I have to admit it's pretty neat. I am alternating now between real books and my Kindle. I can't imagine ever giving up real paper books but who knows? I think anyone who likes to read would appreciate this little devil. Buy one today. Or ask for one as a present!"
"914","I like how this device makes it easy to carry a lot of reading material in a compact and lightweight form. I don't find it as convenient as a paper book for skimming or reviewing what I've read."
"915","This is a fantastic device! I'm enjoying reading so much with this Kindle. Even with no backlight, it's easy to read as long as it's daytime or you just use a lamp. The pages move easily and the font is nice and crisp looking. I love that I can adjust the font as large as I need it. The unit is SO lightweight that I have no problems holding it even though I have bad hand  circulation issues. I'm so glad I took advantage of the $59 deal on this Kindle they recently had."
"916","I own 3 Fire tablets (1st gen, 3rd gen 7"" HDX, and the new 6"" model) but for reading this has become my favorite device. The size and weight are perfect and its portability make it perfect to take with you anywhere. At times I can see the advantage of  the backlit model, but for the price difference, it is not a problem using a portable light. If you want a reader, without the distractions of a tablet, you can't go wrong with this device."
"917","While I prefer the simpler use of the original white Kindle with the buttons, I am slowly getting used to the swipe.  There are a few quirks which I find frustrating, such as the font changing while reading the page with no input from me, and the location information, neither page or location showing and then reappearing, the clarity is still there. I still have trouble making collections and wish that making one would remove the book from the total list shown."
"918","Great E-reader!! The price is PERFECT. Amazon Unlimited gives perfect access to lots of titles. Size is really compact and fits easily into my smaller purses.This version does not have a back light, so No reading without a light.Great product though, and it keeps a charge for weeks."
"919","Awesome"
"920","I really like my Kindle. I love that fact that it is glare-free so when I'm on vacation at the pool, I can still read it like a normal book! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was I wish there was a light/dimmer setting. It would be nice to be able to brighten the background when I'm in a darker location."
"921","Awesome"
"922","I like it surprisingly well.  I like the category options - makes finding my favorite books very easy.  I find reading it to be more difficult than the Kindle DX it replaces.  It seems dark to me.  Yes, I know it isn't back lit but neither was the DX.  I like the touch screen and I'm finding my way around the menus."
"923","so far (only 2 days)  I like it. It works pretty much the same as my Nook with just small differences. Some features that nook doesn't have that this does, like x-ray I like. Would have to wait a while until I have had a chance to use it fefore I can give a proper review."
"924","Awesome"
"925","I put this Kindle side by side with the Paperwhite.  In good lighting, the brightness of the screens are fairly identical as the Paperwhite adjusts to the light within your environment (the darker the room, the more prominent the light). I do like to read in bed and find that lamp light is sufficient when using this Kindle.  However, I must admit that the backlight on the Paperwhite is a nice feature and very convenient.  I got this Kindle around Valentine's Day on sale for $59.99 and there's no way I'm returning it unless it malfunctions.  I'll purchase a book light and use it as a backup reader if nothing else.  On the mechanical side, its very sensitive and at times skips a few pages when I tap to advance to the next page.  From reviews of the Paperwhite (which was $99.99 at the time of my purchase of this Kindle), the Paperwhite has the same issue. It's a little frustrating trying to get back to your place in the book.  Overall, this Kindle is a good e-reader.  I recommend that you really evaluate your reading habits before you purchase this Kindle. If you're used to holding a physical book, then there's not much difference here. Just adjust the light in your environment as usual.  It's lightweight, easy to transport, and has every feature the Paperwhite offers, with the exception of the backlight and the higher price tag.  Its also easy on the eyes, especially for someone who sits in front of bright computer screen all day and desire to give their eyes a break. Overall, I give this Kindle 4 Stars.  It is what it is :-)"
"926","Love it"
"927","I really love my kindle but the only problem I have with it is I wish it had a glow backing option to be able to read at night in the dark and I wish it was a little easier to navigate through different genres.  I do, really like the book suggestions that pop up when it's in a sleep mode and the fact that the ebooks are relatively inexpensive.  Plus Kindle has this new ebooks unlimited option where I can get all these books for free...you can't beat free."
"928","Love it"
"929","This was a gift and the receiver absolutely loved it. She is an early teen that requested books as one of her gift items. How much more perfect can you encourage that love of reading than to gift a Kindle? I do recommend this item and would consider buying one for myself in the future. I happened to purchase it on either Black Friday or Cyber Monday so I also got it at a great price. Kindle has brought books back to the masses. Props to Amazon."
"930","Love it"
"931","Love it"
"932","love it"
"933","Love it"
"934","First things first - I like it a lot.  Very readable, and light enough to hold comfortably in one hand on the Metro for prolonged periods.  Second thing is a question for which the jury is still out: are ""special offers"" worth saving 20 bucks?  Make no mistake - they are ads, and they *are* quite intrusive.  I thought they'd be on the screen only when the unit was asleep, but I was wrong, they're pasted all over the screen along with the books on my Kindle, as well.  I'll probably get used to navigating around them, so I'm in no hurry to pay the reported *30* dollars to remove them.  But they get in the way of a five-star review for now."
"935","I like being able to carry my library in my pocket.  I was surprised by the lack of back light.  This kindle reads exactly like the printed page.  The black and white format is no problem because most of my books are printed in black and white.  This is my first E reader and I am loving it."
"936","Love it!"
"937","I bought this Kindle to replace My Sons which was years old and has stopped charging. I was offered a $20 rebate once I bought it. Right now I am still waiting for the rebate it was ignored for a while. I'm supposed to be getting it on the 20th of November. More than half a month later."
"938","This works really great, but it can be a bit tricky when turning pages. Sometimes it will turn several pages at once and I have to try to figure out which page I'm supposed to be on. (I'm not sure if it is the Kindle or my fingers that are the problem.) I like the ability to change font size on the fly, it makes reading a lot easier. I'm using my Kindle several hours daily now. For the last several years I could only read print books for a half hour a day or less because of the strain from reading smaller fonts. The Kindle has freed me from that problem."
"939","Screen is too sensitive and takes forever to shut off. It has locked up a couple of times forcing a restart. Also doesn't keep very good accounting of Prime books on unit. At times will change pages if you hold side of it (black housing) too strongly.ThanksJim Perry"
"940","I bought this to play ""Every Word"" not supported. Returned this already and they made me pay the shipping back to them. This thing is tiny and wouldn't like to read on it either. Do not recommend this product at all!"
"941","Nothing"
"942","love it"
"943","DON'T BUY A NEW KINDLE if you already have one.It will not have your books on it. And getting them on it from ""the cloud"" is a tedious book-by-book process that will make you decide to go back to paper.I transferred all the old content (only my screen was broken), via USB from old Kindle to new.  When I tried to open the books I was told they were not authorized on the new device, even though it is now registered as my primary device.After chatting with 3 customer service agents (one of whom told me they would fix the problem by assigning the old serial number to my new Kindle), and speaking on line with an agent, I discovered there is no fix for this.Sorry folks.  If you REALLY want to access all those books you OWN... you have to do it one-by-one from ""the cloud"" and you'd better not be someplace where you don't have access to wifi when you want to do it.The stupidity of this defies description since the software fix that would be needed is so obvious and so easy."
"944","It is a big improvement over the original kindle.  I had one of the originals but the battery gave way after many, many hours of use by my wife, a voracious reader, whose final seven years were spent in a nursing home and she simply wore it out.. In addition to the glare free kindle, I bought a kindle fire which I also like very much but I rarely use it as the on/off switch fell off and I have to turn it on or off with a screw driver. I really liked the fire better than the iPad"
"945","My husband does all his reading on a Kindle - this one is the first touch-screen one and took a few minutes training, but it is great.  A good basic Kindle, lightweight, easy to use.  When my original basic Kindle bites the dust, I will get this one also."
"946","I wasn't sure how I would like using an e-reader, so decided cheaper was better.I had to really get used to how sensitive the touch screen is, and how to use my computer along with the kindle to get the books I enjoy.Reading is one of the joys of my life, and using this, I have access to a huge amount of fresh material without dragging books around, making a point of going to a library, so, yeah. I'm now a ""Kindle Convert""."
"947","Awesome."
"948","This is my 3rd Kindle since their release date several years ago.  I never leave the house without my Kindle.  I love the Kindles, the benefits and the flexibility. I can download some of my writings onto my Kindle so I can proofread while I am out of my office, indicate errors, make notes, and utilize all my time.  I like the light weight of the Kindle 6"", and the non-glare screen so I can spend more time outside reading while relaxing."
"949","I love my Kindle so much I bought this one for my daughter to take while studying abroad. Then we downloaded her textbooks so that she wouldn't have to travel with the heavy weights of school books along with all of her luggage. It was worked out great."
"950","Fabulous"
"951","This is my 3rd Kindle.  I like the improvements made over the last 4 years.  The touchscreen makes life so much easier.  Maneuvering through the screens, is so much easier.  I just had to get used to downloading my previously purchased books from the cloud and the removing them when I am done takes some getting used to."
"952","Love it!"
"953","Love it!"
"954","Couldn't be happier. I have the Kindle Fire and do love it but it's much more suited for videos. For a reader it works but it is rather heavy. Whenever I go anywhere I like to take reading material with me for my downtime. Now instead of one book I have my whole library. It's light weight, easy to read in the bright outdoors and I connect using my IPhone when and if I want to download or purchase a new title.  I highly recommend it and the price can't be beat."
"955","I love that the newest baseline Kindle Reader allows for finger-flipping of the pages.  Did I need this?  Perhaps not--since I have the reader on my computer and cell phones.  Yet, this reads so nice.  The letters are big, crisp, and easy on the eyes.  Navigation is not too difficult.  And, unlike my Kindle Fire--the kids don't ""steal"" the readers.  :-)  Thanks Amazon for upgrading, rather than abandoning, your economy reader!"
"956","Love it!"
"957","I can finally read books and save trees lol. E-ink is amazing and the kindle can store many many books internally. Sometimes I wish I had the Paperwhite edition just to have the backlit screen. Otherwise it is awesome for reading and portable"
"958","What else can I add that hasn't been said? I bought this to read at the beach. Love that it syncs with my kindle fire so I can pick up where I left off making sure I sync before I leave home because you need a wifi connection. i have a kindle fire and a nook color. I do prefer to read on those but this is much easier to read in direct sunlight. It's doing the job that I wanted it to do and it does it very well."
"959","The Kindle is perfect for using to read books during my workouts and small enough that I can even hold it as I run laps. It is simple to use and I love turning pages with the touch screen rather than the buttons that were on the frame of my old Kindle Gen 1. I also like the fact that the screen doesn't light up. It is very easy on the eyes.However I am very disappointed with the wi-fi connectivity. It often will not connect and so that makes it hard to look up definitions or use other functions dependent on wi-fi. The experimental browser is useless. It just plain does not work. I never intended to use the Kindle to browse the web but I did want to be able to download books from the library using the Kindle. But the browser is so bad I have never been able to use it to browse and download library books. I have to use my computer or iPhone to get library books for the Kindle. I also wish a power adapter had been included because it is not convenient to charge it on USB. The $19.99 price Amazon charges to buy the power adapter is ridiculously high. The Kindle cover is also overpriced at $29.99. It feels very flimsy - a far cry from the nice leather cover the Kindle Gen 1 had.I bought the Kindle at the $99 price and the next day saw it went on sale for $79. I was happy that Amazon agreed to give me the sale price retroactively. I've seen the Kindle on sale more recently at $59 and wish that I had waited to buy it at that price. I think $99  - and even $79  - is too much considering the problems with wi-fi connectivity and the uselessness of the browser.But all of that said, the device itself is very handy for reading electronic books."
"960","Got this for my 7 year old daughter's birthday.  She wanted a Kindle just like her big sister!  She loves it.  The only problem is that now the older sister wants one with Touchscreen also!  She loves using the Kindle, and still loves to read physical books too.  Best of both worlds."
"961","Love it!!  I had an old old Kindle with the keyboard on the bottom (yes, the letters were pretty well worn off).  It worked well until I spilled a glass of water on it. I have a Kindle Fire HD but I don't want to take it to the beach, etc. I just wanted a reader with wifi that was easy to read. This does it & I did spring for ""no ads"" because they are too annoying.  Happy!!"
"962","This basic Kindle is a great value and I love it!  It's like having any paperback you want to read at your side anytime, anyplace.  The touchscreen works great and is the best I've found for reading in sunny conditions. It's very book-like and easy on the eyes.  It's not backlit; but then again neither are my traditional books!My current endeavor is learning Spanish. With the Kindle, it's easy to select words of interest.  These highlighted words are automatically added to my vocabulary list, which I can then review at leisure.  ¡Excelente!"
"963","I was very disappointed in this version of the Kindle. The  Touch screen is so sensitive that even just brushing my clothes against it, changed the  chapter location in the book I was reading. My previous  years of  enjoyment of  reading on the Kindle was GONE due to the erratic behavior of this version. After I struggled to read just one book on this new Kindle,  returned it and bought the keyboard version which I am now enjoying using again."
"964","very good"
"965","Excellent"
"966","all good"
"967","I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY NEW KINDLE.  IT IS VERY LIGHT WEIGHT AND DOES NOT TIRE ME TO HOLD IT UP.  I WOULD LIKE IT MORE IF I COULD FIND A STAND FOR IT SO IT COULD SIT ON THE ARM OF MY CHAIR.  MY OTHER KINDLE HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR YEARS AND ACTS UP EVERY NOW AND THEN."
"968","This is my 4th Kindle.  I had the first one, then upgraded, then got a Kindle Fire.  I've loved them all.  The Kindle Fire is great when I travel as I can do e-mail and go on line but it is much larger and heavier.  This Kindle E-reader is so small and light weight and has the ""paper"" screen, I love it for reading!! It is easy to read, fits easily in a purse and the battery lasts forever."
"969","Hubby bought this for my 10 year old daughter. She loves it and we can also check out library e books on it. I like that there is no blue light background. The charge lasts a long time (several weeks)."
"970","I've had this for a year now. My only complaint about it is, it loses its place if I don't exit out to the home menu before closing it for the day. Love the e-ink and the fact it's a simple ereader. It was exactly what I wanted."
"971","I bought this because I am a big Kindle fan. I have a Google Nexus 7 with the Kindle Reading app. When I sit on my deck in good weather, the glare of my tablet is annoying. The eReader solves that problem. It's very light, but I had to get used to its different interface. Should have paid closer attention to the introductory screens providing an overview of the interface. But I eventually figured it out in a few hours. I just wish I had reached my decision to buy this back in January 2015 when it was still on sale for $20 less than I paid for it. LOL!"
"972","I love it"
"973","i like it"
"974","excelente"
"975","poor view"
"976","Perfect!!"
"977","very lite. Touchscreen is easier for my arthritic fingers.  My experience with Amazon has been excellent. The orders arrive quickly and if you need to return an item, there's no problem. The customer service reps are professional, knowledgeable of items sold, patient and efficient."
"978","I love this for outdoor reading! I bought this because anything with light displays are difficult to see out in the sun but this works perfect. Also, if the back lit screen bothers my eyes on my iPad, I just switch to this! I work many hours staring at a computer screen and this helps when I want to read a book. Who uses paper books anymore? The battery life is long lasting between charges."
"979","I received the Kindle 7th Generation as a Christmas gift and have really been enjoying it.  Since this is my first Kindle, it took some learning and getting used to how it works.  The ""user guide"" is disappointing and not very user friendly.  However, I am using my Kindle every day and reading on it is a real pleasure.  Downloading new ""books"" to read almost instantly on my Kindle is really nice.  I would recommend the Fintie Kindle 7th Gen SmartShell Case for security and comfort.  If I upgrade to another Kindle in the future, I think the back-lit model would be useful for low light reading."
"980","I recently retired my original Kindle and purchased the Kindle  with glare-free touchscreen display. It is so much more than just a reading device. I love it.It did take a few days to get used to the touch screen. You have to learn 'hands-off' of the screen unless you're changing pages or need to access information. My old kindle had the buttons for accessing information.But, this one is really clear and easy to use."
"981","Wonderful"
"982","good deal"
"983","Excellent"
"984","It is a great concept. This is the first Kindle I have owned. But I have to reboot it every time I want to use it. And it is made of chinsy material. It feels like it will break in my hand. The plug has already mangled the power input, and I've only had the Kindle for a few days (less than a week). I will have to return this soon because I am sure it won't last me even a year."
"985","Love this kindle. Easy to use, lightweight, great readability. I thought I'd never like this because I really love books, but this isn't so bad after all. It's very light and easy to hold in one hand. No glare on the screen which is really nice."
"986","The Kindle 6"" has been a handy little gadget for when I am going to college. It is nice to have to read not only text books for school, but also books that I download from Amazon. It is nice to have the glare-free touch screen. Easy to read with the white background."
"987","Considering the price, the device is great.  My 8 year old son needed a way to read some of the Kindle books we had purchased for the older kids, but he did not have a device. Since he sleeps with a night light anyways, the lack of backlighting is not an issue. Plus, with the parental controls, he can only read with it and only the books we curate for him. He loves it and it has helped him increase his reading minutes at school and home. I only left it four stars because buyers should be aware, the screen refresh is a little slow and it does not have backlighting."
"988","I ordered this Kindle on Wednesday July 15, 2015 for $49 but now I do not see an order in my order history.  I am very disappointed as this was to be a gift for my mother and now if I plan to do this I have to spend $79 instead.  Very upset and don't understand what happened with my order."
"989","I was very disappointed that this item is not back lit as I love to read in bed at night without the lights on.  I got it after having a Nook which is getting old and starting to have issues.  I had heard that the kindle was easy and convenient to use.  I don't know if it is because I am used to using the Nook, but I found the Kindle confusing to use."
"990","The screen on this device is TOO DARK and cannot be lightened up.  I was very disappointed when I received it.  I thought this would be the perfect tablet for just reading books, but, unfortunately, it is going back."
"991","Its very easy to use the only set back is why is there no back light you would think the Kindle's been around a while and would put a backlight on even it's most basic model. Happy but not satisfied, but I'm sure you people will shrug and say oh well buy our higher model."
"992","I liked it but it takes a lot of geting used to it. My other kindle had the books automatically transfered to the kindle and were not in the cloud. I like them being in the cloud because you can read one book at a time. the page turner buttons on this kindle are easier to use than on my other one, but i seem to have to go to the cloud to download a book every time while with the older kindle I did not have to. Its easier to turn this kindle on and off as well. I am still learning this kindle. I am looking forward to learning more about it and just need to get a case for it."
"993","I love my Kindle ... I just want to read and this is perfect, However  do consider getting a reading light if you're not in a well lit reading area. I have been having a hard time finding a good one. Waiting for one I ordered from Amazon to arrive so we will see how that one is. I don't know if the covers that come with a built in reading light are the best option, for I did not get one, so you may want to consider this also.Hands down awesome , light , long battery life, fits easily in my purse. =)"
"994","I love the fact that I can once again read my Kindle in my hand rather than on my PC. Not a big fan of reading on the computer...I don't know how I survived the internet, probably all the bells and whistles and colors and info. Anyway. this is my second kindle since I broke the first one I had by kneeing it to death while it was under the covers. Anyway, I like my first one better. I don't particularly like touching the screen to go from page to page. I liked the page turner on the hardware side of the Kindle instead. I don't really like the ability to put in a page number instead of hunting from page to page. I should be awing and ooohing at this technology, but I think it might have something to do with stopping to put in the page number which to me is a bit of a delay in this age of instant gratification. It's still a great piece of technology and one day in the future all books and textbooks will be read on a kindle which will save the trees."
"995","great item"
"996","Every okey"
"997","Love it !!"
"998","I like it."
"999","Seriously, how did I live without a Kindle for so long? Kindle apps are all well and good, but it just isn't the same. It isn't as ""cute"" as some of the animated options out there, but  I didn't realize how much eye strain there was from reading with a backlit screen until I switched from the app to using a Kindle with e-ink. And the battery lasts forever."
"1000","This is fine for just reading books. I do get a slight glare with my attached iKross clip on light when I have the light aimed straight at the screen, but tilting the screen and adjusting light helps. I haven't tried this outside in sunlight yet. I had a Kindle Fire before, and the backlight gave me headaches with extended reading, which is why I bought this one. Works great for just reading..."
"1001","An excellent device that even skeptics will grow to love. I love the smell and feel of real books, but when I was on vacation, I spent a week with no internet connection nor cell phone signal and had to rely on my books to keep me company. During this stay, I had luckily preemptively downloaded a bunch of books to the device, and I plowed straight through 4 or 5 of them. This would not have been possible if I had to carry 4 or 5 books on every trip.As for the specifications on the device: I recommend splurging a bit to get the paperwhite, particularly if you like reading at dusk or while traveling. This version is pleasant while there's adequate light, but if there is inconsistent light, say from reading while on a train, you will become frustrated. The paperwhite with a backlight is much better in this regard. In addition, I do wish that it was a little bit larger, as I have to either hold it with two hands, or between my palm and my abductor pollucis (meat of the thumb) to balance it; more non-screen space for leverage is welcome and would make reading upside down or at angles easier.My last quip about this device is that the exterior scratches fairly easily. I left my kindle in my backpack while traveling, but it suffered no huge distress and has little scratches that can be distracting from the page. Definitely recommend purchasing with a cover of some sort.The positives:I love the screen, it really does feel like paper, and there's about as much readable area as a normal book. Customizable fonts are nice, the area allocated to touch is nice, sensitivity is adequate, if a bit too much, and overall does its job well.The data transfer system is excellent, as I can download books, either from Amazon or through a third party service, and put them on the device via USB easily. The experimental browser and goodreads are nice bonuses that I don't really use, but you could. It's very easy to share books with friends/family as well.It's very light and pleasant to carry around, no matter how heavy the reading you're doing is.Great volume lets you read as many books as you want and you can set up a buffet of reading for whatever you're in the mood for, rather than being limited by what you have with you.Overall - Recommended, but consider the other models first to best match your needs."
"1002","This is a nice little reading device. It's held up well for the past few months of travel.What I don't like is that the black plastic scratches and streaks easily. It's kind of distracting when you're reading a book to see streaks in the black plastic finish. Wish I could have gotten this in a different color."
"1003","I preferred the listing of books to be in text. The screen is not easily managed with the thumbnail images. With practice, however, I will become more comfortable with using it. one of the problems with my old Kindle is the glare; the touchscreen display on the new one is glare-free, so that is a plus."
"1004","LOVE IT!!!!"
"1005","This is my third Kindle. I love all three!  My first one was the 2nd Gen. When the Fire came out I had to have one. I gave my first one away. I love my fire. I keep that one next to my bed so that I can read at night.  I bought the 3rd one because I was going on vacation to the beach and wanted to be able to read. I also enjoy reading on my back deck. The fire is not for using in the sun because of the glare. Now that vacation is over the 6' is perfect for carrying around in my purse for reading emergencies. People need to fully read product descriptions before they buy stuff. It does not come with a light. I've had with buttons and without. Both work great. Kindle products are awesome!!"
"1006","Works great"
"1007","This was such a great purchase. I have the Kindle app for my iPad, but I hated how heavy it was to hold while reading, especially while laying down. I love that there is no glare on the screen, can literally take this anywhere! Battery lasts way longer than an iPad, too. I throw it in my bad wherever I go."
"1008","great value"
"1009","could not see screen in dim light"
"1010","I can't say enough good things about this.  I have dropped mine several times, my kids borrow it and abuse it and it works and looks like new.  I have owned several of the ""other"" brands and paid hundreds of dollars for the color tablet kinds at that other book store only to find they are heavy and unpleasant to read on.  I prefer reading on this to any other of the several I own."
"1011","There isn't much new to say about a Kindle reader than it hasn't already been said. I can't recommend enough owing a Kindle, and try for yourself if it is for you. Some people say that they still prefer reading on paper books. It's hard to argue with them, but if you are not one of those persons, you will find the Kindle reader to be one of your best tech products."
"1012","I love the look of the screen. I bought the device simply because I hate reading on a bright screen and books get destroyed. However, the interface is terrible. It's really ugly and not fun to use. But I would say what's worse is how plagued with advertisements this thing is. It's shameless to turn the lock screen of my device into a billboard for your company's products. Perhaps I am just new to e readers, but that is a practice that needs to change."
"1013","Love kindle 's these are Christmas gifts for our grandkids. Who love to read. They were big winners for this year's Christmas. I was very happy that Amazon adjusted my bill when they went on sale a few days after I had received them. Amazon's support are great.Thanks Amazon"
"1014","This little digital reader is perfect for those of use who get eye strain and headaches after reading books on phones, tablets, or computers.  The size is perfect to hold in one hand during long reading sessions, and the font options are great.  I use a smaller font, but can enlarge it for books my children read.  Book downloads are quick and so simple, I'm  sure I could hand this little device off to my non-technical friends and family members without a glitch.  If you just want a straight forward ereader without bells and whistles, this kindle is for you."
"1015","Glare free!"
"1016","Yes, I knew this was not ""lighted"" like the Paperwhite but I did not expect it to be so dark. Others have likened it to reading a paperback and having to do so in a lit room but I can guarantee that the pages of a paperback are much whiter and brighter than this old, yellow thing. I don't really understand why Kindle/Amazon have this item still available and haven't at least upgraded the background to a brighter image. I almost feel like I'm being punished for not wanting to spend twice as much for a light! It is apparent that the glare-free screen is necessary because the reader must be held up to bright light just to be readable! Not a fan....wondering how much it will cost me to return a product that probably shouldn't even be on the market!"
"1017","works great"
"1018","COOL SCREEN"
"1019","I gave this to my favorite Aunt for Christmas. At 89 she reads her Bible daily from her Kindle now. She loves it and I am so glad to find yet another gift that she appreciates and can use. Keep this in mind for your elderly loved one, help them set it up and have them enjoy modern technology and the convenience of thousands of titles to chose from right from their easy chair."
"1020","As the owner of an original Kindle Model #1, I am very pleased with this product.Pro's:  It's fast.  Real fast.  It took me a few days to get use to how quick it was changing pages due to the V.1.Cons:  the touch screen can be very sensitive.  A twitch of your finger when turning pages may cause the device to change two pages instead of just one.  Not a huge deal, and not worth removing even a 1/4 of a star.I highly suggest this Kindle for anybody who wants an e-reader."
"1021","I am so amazed at the clairity of this display and how easy it is to work.  The charger is not needed because my phone charger works with it just fine so I am glad I did not invest in the extra charger.It arrived in wonderful condition and in good time."
"1022","I really like the size of the kindle.  The backlight is subtle and does not hurt the eyes.  I carry it around in my purse and can use it in quite a few areas. It is amazing how compact and convenient the KINDLE Touchscreen is.  DCB"
"1023","Perfect.  But I do with Amazon would come out with a reader that combines the light up screen and the way this turns the pages.  Love being able to click on the side rather than having to swipe the page.  Bought this as a gift.  I already own one."
"1024","I have Kindle on my laptop already I don't need or want another screen to carry around.  What I need is Kindle Fire program for my laptop and tablet.  Like I said the last thing I need is another piece of EQ to pack on my wheelchair.  If you can't help me then I'll have to contact National Geographic so they can start mailing me their ""dead tree"" things and write off Kindle."
"1025","I'm a long time Kindle owner and absolutely love mine, so I decided to buy one as a gift for my mother. Well, shame on me for not looking more closely when purchasing in the store (Best Buy), because the lack of a back light is a problem. I can understand this being a budget model and using a lower resolution screen but I can't fathom why removing the back light would be an acceptable decision for an e-reader.Again, it's my own fault for not reading more carefully (I didn't have to make such a distinction when I bought mine), but I would NOT recommend this kindle model to others."
"1026","works great"
"1027","Great reader! These were gifted to my children (ages 10-11) and are quite user friendly. My two favorite features are the Kindle Free Time and the vocabulary builder. We home educate and these two features are a great way for me to keep an eye on their free time reading (time aside from assigned reading) and how their vocabulary is growing (if they are reading challenging enough books). Already an indispensable tool for our home school. Thank you Kindle for a wonderful product."
"1028","This is my 2nd Kindle.  The 1st I re-gifted when I received my iPad but then I found that I needed another one as I simply cannot read any of the tablets we own outside.  It's perfect size for my hand as well as for my purse or whatever bag / tote I am carrying."
"1029","It is super!"
"1030","Excellent !!"
"1031","will cherish"
"1032","I love books, I have always loved books. When the e-reader craze started I was horrified. I would never give up my precious bookswith their sound, their smell, their magic. But then I married a man who's job allowed him to travel. I realized touring my entire library across the country would be completely ridiculous, so I bought a kindle. I bought it solely for the sake of portability with the expectation of hating it for it's coldness, the coldness of technology. I was wrong. It reads wonderfully, the pages turn seamlessly. I forget sometimes while I'm reading that it isn't a book, it is the perfect size and weight and without a backlight it reads just like paper. There is no screen glare with the exception of a particular angle in direct sunlight which is easy enough to avoid. While I do believe I may just be falling in love with this little electronic device I am certainly not turning my back on ""real"" books, I bought one just the other day in fact. However if you are the type to carry a book with you this is by far a game changer, you can have as many books as you like all in one place."
"1033","High quality"
"1034","She loves it"
"1035","It is a usable device but requires extra lighting. The gray-scale background is very dark and unhelpful in certain lights. It is difficult to scroll through the books and find something particular because the true cover of the book isn't shown. You have to read all the titles on the page to find the one you want. The search function is fine if you remember the correct title or the author's name, but is confusing in the icons along the side of books. And relatively useless at guessing what you want if you omit one letter from a title. But it works, holds my books, allows downloads anywhere there is wifi."
"1036","This is a GREAT E-reader! I upgraded from the very first kindle... which still works perfectly, just wanted something a little easier to use instead of using the  buttons to choose everything. I do wish i would have gotten the backlit screen but my led light works perfect. I read constantly and before the kindle i had TONS of books everywhere, love that i can now keep them all at my fingertips in one small device. I also recently took this to Florida and read on the beach with no glare at all. Like i said the only drawback is that it doesn't have a lit screen, i feel like this should now just be a constant on all e-readers instead of having to pay extra for it."
"1037","I was worried with this being a lower end device that it would be lacking in quality and features. It is not! As long as you're in light suitable for reading a paper book, you will have no issues reading the text on this Kindle. Load it up with books from a wifi connection, charge it, and you're literally set for weeks.Don't fret over saving the money and opting to receive 'Special Offers.' They're unobtrusive and you'll rarely notice them."
"1038","I gave this 4 stars because sometimes, when I touch to turn the page, it will advance several pages, making me back track one page at a time to search for where I left off. Otherwise, I'm really enjoying it.UPDATING REVIEW - Change from 4 stars to 1. Received on May 15, 2015, used an hour or so per day, on July 6, 2015, the device froze up. The only thing I am able to read are the Ads Amazon so kindly provides. I have contacted Amazon and am informed that they cannot do an exchange, but that it is under warranty, whatever that means. I will update this review when I learn just what Amazon will do to back up their product.UPDATING REVIEW - The response to the above problem was swift and fixed. I was very pleased with the help and the device is now up and running. So I'm changing this back to 4 stars."
"1039","a must have!"
"1040","With some trepidation last Christmas I gave this Kindle to my dad, who is 93. At first he had some trouble with it but now he absolutely loves it. Since it is on my account I get his books. I am able to get a lot of library books online for him. It's great! Some of his books are free. Of course I buy him some too. I believe his Kindle has added to the quality of his life. And I know what to get him this Christmas: an Amazon gift card."
"1041","This kindle is a huge improvement over my earlier version with all the buttons. It's nice having a touch screen and the font is easier to read. I would have liked to try the paper white model but got a REALLY good deal on this during Prime Day."
"1042","I received a kindle for Christmas and I absolutely love it. I am also an iPad owner but I prefer the kindle for reading as the electronic ink is much easier on my eyes. The back lighting is pretty decent and very useful for compensating for lower light conditions. I was concerned that it would kill the battery life quickly but it seems to be good. I only charge it about every two weeks."
"1043","I have an older Kindler e-reader that wasn't syncing so needed to upgrade. I'd had it for about 5+ years.  The new e-reader is easy to use.  I LOVE the non-glare feature.  I hate having to move my tablet as I read to eliminate the glare whether I'm inside or outside.  If you're an avid reader this feature is for you.  I was hesitate to go from a 3G to Wi-Fi but it hasn't been a problem.  Lots of free Wi-Fi areas.  The size and weight are nice.  It fits easily in my handbag.  I don't get tired of holding it as I read."
"1044","I bought the LDS Scriptures, Old and New Testaments and the Book of Mormon.  However, I haven't been able to figure out how to go to chapter and verse that I want to refer to so I've just put it aside, hoping someone can show me what to do to bring up chapter and verse to study a particular topic.  There don't seem to be any instructions to help with this.  With my physical Scriptures I can look up something in the Topical Guide and then go to all the scriptures covering that subject.  The Kindle seems to be useless if there's no way to do that.Beverly Portlock"
"1045","Plan to return it. Was not what I expected."
"1046","Needs a light"
"1047","Easy to read."
"1048","I received this for my birthday and I love it!! I had no intention of getting a kindle as I have long standing arthritis and didn't want to deal with any buttons. When I happened to come across how it was going to be updated to touchscreen, I knew I had to have it.I read everyday; and still read actual books. However, for authors like Phillippa Gregory whose books are enourmous the Kindle has been great. It is as light as they say. I work for the local library and read so much and now I can get downloads from two different libraries and using amazon for lending is very easy, especially if you register your kindle under your amazon account. Then you can manage however you like, all the books.Thanks Amazon for another great invention."
"1049","This is my first Kindle. As a busy college student, I bought this item for leisure reading in my free time. I love its compact size and that I can download books very quickly and easily. I read from it between classes and on my commute to school.  I like the fact that it is easy on the eyes and relatively easy to navigate. I love the dictionary! I would not otherwise take the time to look up words I don't know. The fact that there is no backlight is no problem at all. If there is enough light in the room to read a book, then you read from the kindle. Actually, I think the kindle might be easier to read in low light than some books due to its bright background. The lack of back-light will be a deal breaker if you like to read in the dark. The special offers are not intrusive to me and occasionally some of them spark my interest. Overall, I like it. It is great for what I use it for. I would definitely make this purchase again.Nit Picks:1. I hate when dust gets on the screen, it makes it appear like pieces of the letters did not materialize. I got the amazon case to go with it and dust particles still get on the screen. Not a big deal though. Debris have a much more negative impact on e-ink screens.2. I wish there were instructions on all of the features on the kindle. There was a short tutorial upon set up, but I run across other features that I would like to know function of.3.  Because people can self-publish via amazon, there are a lot a crappy books out there for cheap/free, but don't be discouraged there are good ones too.4. I wish the transitions between tasks was smoother. It would be a much nice experience. I definitely would not use this to browse the web."
"1050","I had an earlier model that was not touch screen. The new version has more space and touch screen navigation. I really like the size of my Kindle. It does fit into a pocket and is easy to hold and operate with one hand. The glare free screen is easy on the eyes and more like reading a paper book. I really like that the font size and style can be changed to what suits me and anyone's preference. If your eyesight is not what it was you can adjust the Kindle to a more suited size.  I  like that I can store hundreds of books on the device, so I can read several books without the cumbersome task of carrying multiple books. I also like the built in dictionary that enables you to look up a word within the book you are reading. The price for the device is great. Amazon makes this affordable for anyone. The many days battery life is also a great feature. This device has really made reading so much more enjoyable. If you like to read or need to read you should get a Kindle."
"1051","After years of using the Kindle software on my 7"" tablet with no problem, I recently began to develop eyestrain after reading for long periods of time. That doesn't happen with the Kindle's glare-free, e-ink screen, even if I use it with a small book light for reading in bed. The display is actually much sharper than I had expected for a non-back-lit screen. Another unexpected benefit of the Kindle over my tablet is that it is so lightweight. It's easy to hold in one hand, and the touch screen makes it easy to turn pages while doing so. I absolutely love my new Kindle!"
"1052","I've got two of these devices for Christmas presents. So far they are working fine, I have not used them to much yet. I have had a kindle device before 5th generation, still working like a champ. I hope my mother and brother are going to love them as much as I love my old kindle."
"1053","Love it: more portable and versatile than original Kindle, a tough little piece of hardware that goes anywhere. Amazon does it again by offering, for free, all e-books from my previous version's library. If you don't love Amazon, you don't love America! :)"
"1054","Great product."
"1055","great purchase"
"1056","Pretty simple."
"1057","IT'S A READER."
"1058","SÃºper Nice !!!"
"1059","good experience"
"1060","nothing like my old one..not worth the money."
"1061","Great product!"
"1062","Love the lightness and small size.  Screen doesn't turn kittywonkas when not straight, a real plus.  Easy to read, easy to turn pages forward and back, just by a tap on either side of the screen.  Basically, this has replaced my Kindle Fire for READING purposes.  It was easy to transfer my e-books from the Kindle Fire to this."
"1063","Very easy to use and no problem with charging the battery- Would recommend for anyone with difficulty holding larger ereaders-larger size Kindle is preferred but this is easy to carry in your pocket or purse"
"1064","Bought this to replace my Nook which died.  Very happy with this model - quick page turns, the light gray screen is easy on the eyes, and the battery last a long time before recharging.  I had tried the Kindle Paperwhite last year, but the white screen a little bright for my eyes and wasn't happy with battery draining quickly, so I gave it to a friend.  This one is perfect for my needs.  Love it."
"1065","doesn't do much"
"1066","Awesomely cool!"
"1067","Very satisified"
"1068","Very well done!"
"1069","Good expierence"
"1070","What I expected"
"1071","Awesome device."
"1072","Nice reader. Works well and keeps a charge a long time. Tip on the screen though; if you hold the power button in for a few seconds a dialogue appears so you can shut off the screen so it doesn't display the ""ads"" for other books or content you paid $20 less for.  Also my cats seem to be in a pool to see how many times they can knock it off whatever table its on and it still works fine, though I got the 3 Year guarantee if I break it.  Recommend it if you just love reading like I do with no frills."
"1073","I love my Kindle (7th generation)--it is my e-reader.  I like that I am able to adjust the font size of the words, to my size preference. The Kindle allows you to highlight passages, as well as to bookmark pages.  I like that I can download several e-books onto my Kindle, so I have several e-books to choose from, when I take my Kindle with me on vacation.  I highly recommend this product."
"1074","Obviously the kindle is great, with good functionality!! However I must admit I was disappointed to find that the kindle does not work with 5ghz WiFi, so if you have that in your home or office it may be difficult for you to instantly download and sync books."
"1075","I bought this as a gift for my daughter who is in her 20's and I think it may be on the top ten best gifts ever because she calls me almost every day to tell me how much she loves it. She then proceeds to tell me what she is reading. We talk all the time now about what books are on our Kindle's and we are loving it!"
"1076","I own the first Kindle model made, and when it died, I was forced to buy a new one. I am still getting used to the newer features, but I do like it. My only complaint is the process of switching my old Kindle to the new one. I found that all of my husband's books are now on my device, and I really don't want them. I, alone, have over 650 books on mine, and have no need for his. Overall, once I am more familiar with the features, I am sure to continue to love the new as much as I did the old."
"1077","Disappointing..."
"1078","Too dark to read"
"1079","OK, kind of slow"
"1080","Used this while we were traveling.  It was easier to read in the sunlight than my Kindle Fire.  I like that I can go back and forth between the Fire and this one and they both keep track of the last page read."
"1081","After two years of dropping hints, Hubby got this for me last Christmas.I love this thing. I have several books, but mostly I keep my knitting patterns on PDFs. It is so handy and great to use. No more paper patterns dropping on the floor or fluttering off. It's all tight there. It's a knitter's dream when it comes to pattern organization.The only con is that it's not back lit for bedtime reading. However, that doesn't really bother me all that much.Total, total love this thing."
"1082","I love my Kindle. It's so much easier than reading a paperback or hard cover book. Don't get me wrong... I love to have an actual book but in reality I really want something that is easier to carry with me everywhere I go and also I'd like to not have so much clutter. I bought 2. One for myself and one for the boyfriend. We both carry them everywhere we go. He is able to fit his in the pocket of his jeans and that is with a case on. I am easily able to fit it in my purse."
"1083","I love this Kindle. I bought to replace my generation 2 or 3 kindle which still works 6 years later, but doesn't hold a charge for very long. I love the touch screen. Of course, downloading is easy, plenty of selections, and the screen is awesome in daylight!! I can't wait to take this on vacation to the beach and be able to read all day. This is smaller than my old one and even easier to carry everywhere I go. Love it!!"
"1084","As with all Amazon products this meets all expectations.  It even fits my old Kindle case.  It is easy to use and the New features include telling you who a character in the story is with just one touch.  No bells and whistles just an easy reader."
"1085","Kindle me this.  What?  Just trying to be funny.  A bit of humor, writing out yet again another review.  I have 4 Kindles so yes, it works great.  Kindle is the way to go.  I hope someday they will allow folders on them so you can have one folder for each subject matter and maybe even subjected.  Why not?"
"1086","My wife likes it"
"1087","I love my kindle"
"1088","This is my second Kindle and I love it. It is a great way to read books. Now I don't have hundreds of paperbacks accumulating all the time. And I don't have to go to the bookstore when I need a new book!"
"1089","It's awesome!  I wanted something I could read in the car, so I didn't get a Kindle Fire.  It is a little hard to read the book covers on the home page unless I actually click on the book. Other than that, there is really no problem at all.  If I am ever able to get another, I will move up the the Paperwhite."
"1090","Awesome. Love it!"
"1091","Doing fine so far"
"1092","Still learning it"
"1093","My Mom loves it!!"
"1094","Its abit smaller than I thought however, I like that it is compact enough to fit into any of my handbags without being too clumpy. I should have taken the advice of other reviews and gotten the upgraded version with a lighted screen. This was my first time ordering a device of this type. I am happy with everything else. Easy to use, downloads pretty fast and the text is the prefect size for me."
"1095","Light weight and the right size for holding at just the right angle for comfort while reading makes Kindle 6"" an excellent reader. The screen is easy on the eyes and the no glare screen makes it easy to read by the pool.  This is my second Kindle.  I also have a Kindle Fire."
"1096","I chose to give the Kindle a try rather than build another book case.  We have a lot of classics and Newbery Award books on our shelves and use the Library extensively.  My hope is to transition many of those books to the Kindle over time and use my current book cases for more reference type books.I like its easy on the eyes display as I spend most of my work days staring into a monitor as well as the dictionary and X-ray functions.  We do a lot of reading as a family and I am often asked what a particular word means.  The X-Ray function helps show the kids particular threads amongst characters and within the plot so I am looking forward to using that in particular.The one issue I have with the product thus far is the cumbersome approach to managing ""FreeTime"".  I have only had the product for a week, but so far the only way I know to add books to each of my children's profiles is through the Amazon ""Manage My Device"" web page.  It would be nice if I could manage this on the Kindle itself."
"1097","without having ads would have had one more star from me"
"1098","DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU LIKE TO READ AT NIGHT!! I read a lot, especially at night when the wife is asleep. Per some reviews I've read and pictures I've seen, I assumed that I would be able to read with this kindle in the dark. Well I was wrong. Unfortunately I did not discover this until I turned it on."
"1099","Neither the person who gifted this to me nor I understood that ¨Special Offers¨ meant I would be constantly seeing ads on the home screen, despite having paid for both the device and the content. I am accustomed to seeing ads when they support content or services I am not paying for - but this is just annoying. Perhaps I will just avoid buying my ebooks from amazon. Using only ebooks borrowed through libraries, for instance. I already had kindle support on my smartphone, and prefer paper books most of the time. Probably why I am a late adopter of an ebook reader. The ads make it even less appealing"
"1100","does not light up"
"1101","Can't beat the price. Easy to read in bright sun.  Super lightweight and small.No back light so no reading in bed.  I knew this going in but was more of an issue than I expected.Buy this for the beach, that's about all its good for."
"1102","Am more impressed with it the more I learn to use it. It would be nice to have a light for those darker places that I read, but I knew it didn't before I purchased it. It is much more convenient than I expected. I am still learning how to access, download, etc but am very happy with the purchase."
"1103","Love it. I've been using a kindle app on my phone for ages, but wanted to get a real kindle for serious reading. The kindle screen is so much easier on my eyes than my backlit phone. It's easy to use and books download quickly. The goodreads integration is awesome because it makes it easy for me to track what I've read and rate finished books."
"1104","Bought 3 of these for my girlfriend, my mother, and my grandmother. It's the most convenient way to read all of your books in one place and it doesn't hurt your eyes like reading on a tablet/iPad for hours does."
"1105","I love my kindle!!"
"1106","Ordered wrong item"
"1107","Good for the money"
"1108","Easy to read from."
"1109","Excellent product!"
"1110","Very well, thanks!"
"1111","wifi function broken in the first week,no love anymore 😖"
"1112","I like my kindle and naturally you get what you pay for and I did not want to pay too much for a kindle. However, the only thing i don't like is that this kindle has no light in the dark, thus I""d need to have my light on in order to read. Othat then that it's fine & light, comfortable to bring it with you when you travel."
"1113","Love this version, really small so it  fits in  my purse, which is not a huge bag, does not cost a fortune so if I have to replace it I do not feel horrible, and I am able to read it in the sunlight, unlike my phone screen."
"1114","I am so glad that this has been updated to a touch screen format because the first editions were not user-friendly at all.We purchased 2 of the new editions for our daughters as a Christmas gift. They used the first editions when they were younger and we ended up shelving them due to constantly having to assist with navigation. We haven't had to do anything to help them (ages 9 and 11) with the exception of setting up the accounts on the new editions.If your goal is to simply read, and do light browsing on Al Gore's Internet, these are perfect. Even my 74 year old grandmother, who has trouble with her DirecTV remote was able to use this, bless her heart. I am very pleased with the new Kindle e-Reader!"
"1115","love it! The screen is clear and crisp even though its not 300ppi. I don't care about having an internal light because I treat my kindle like a book and don't read in bed. In fact, I did not buy a paperwhite because I don't want a light that can't be turned off. Also, the kindle is lighter than the paperwhite and weight is a factor for me. I really appreciated that it has a wonderful touch screen and no buttons. I did not consider the voyage because of its price and other features such as the buttons and light which I don't care about. My only general complaint is that its really difficult to port my epub stuff over from my nook if it has DRM on it, and I believe many amazon books do too. I would love to buy a book and be able to have it on any device I own. What a novel concept ;)"
"1116","I wanted a basic Kindle and this worked out perfectly. I used to read my books on a full tablet but the glare was always a problem. This model is bare bones but is perfect for reading on public transit. The compact size is just right to carry around when traveling. I am enjoying it very much."
"1117","I love how easy it is to read on.I don't like the set up/home screen as much and find it a little difficult to use.The books download super fast. It is light-weight. Battery seems to last a while."
"1118","Absolutely amazed. Now I can take a dictionary, books, magazines, and newspaper publications backpacking with my dog and I. I just open it up and I'm immediately at the location where I left off reading. I'm getting more reading in than ever without toting a book bag around. This will be the next wave in education."
"1119","Screen is very dark"
"1120","I don't know if I just got a lemon, but this thing broke within 24 hours - completely froze up and would not do anything. Contacted customer service, tried a couple of things (again), still wouldn't do anything. Was not able to come to a satisfactory resolution with customer service regarding a replacement, so I ended up just returning this. Will not buy a kindle again. For the few minutes I was able to use it (just to set it up), it was very slow to respond."
"1121","complaints:- I had not understood that there was no backlight, and it seems absurd to have to use a room light to read an electronic device. Maybe I should have dug more, but the absence of this feature is not easy to find in the product description.- when you navigate, the screen reverses shade to let you know something is happening. It looks like the device is having a small seizure and is a poor design choice to show the thing is working properly.- the ""Experimental Browser"" is a confusing and half-assed feature. Does it work or not? If no, why ship it? Mine did not work. I was unable to go to Dropbox and access my library, which was a critical thing for me."
"1122","It is as expected."
"1123","You can read the reviews on the Kindle yourself. I just want to point out something that was a bit of a revelation to me. I had always figured that since I had numerous phones and tablets which utilized the Amazon Kindle app, I would never want a Kindle. I decided to pick one up during a great sale just to see what they were like. Since buying the Kindle, I find that I read books much more often than before I had the Kindle. You won't be distracted with Facebook or any of those other things that seem to distract you with constant notifications on the Kindle. It's just you and the book.Apart from all that, the Kindle is great. It's easy to use and the battery life is insane. It literally lasts for weeks at a time. If you've been on the fence about buying one, just do it. You will not regret it."
"1124","I know it has been  while since this kindle was purchased  and I should have done this earlier but here goes.When I order a book I never know where it will be sometimes on device and sometimes in the cloud,  Thats ok  if I just ordered but when I preorder it ends up in the cloud  then getting it on the device  can be a pain.If I am reading a book it doesn't become #1 on device it stays where it was which means if I do anything else on the kindle I have to search it out again.  All in all I am unhappy with this touchscreen kindle."
"1125","I bought this for my grandmother who had to stop reading print books because of her eye sight.  She is absolutely pleased because she can read again. With her being bed ridden this is the best thing ever!"
"1126","I bought this entry-level Kindle and quickly discovered that I like reading Kindle books, but in the end I regretted buying the cheap model because it's not as easy to read as a Paperwhite. I subsequently bought a Paperwhite and I like it much better."
"1127","T was a real bargain but I really didn't need it since I get Kindle on my iPad. But there are some books that will not download except on the Kindle it's wonderfully light , compact and easy to read. I travel with the Kindle as well as the iPad and read only on the Kindle - thus saving iPad battery usage. The price was my main reason for buying it."
"1128","I still get a glare"
"1129","Not what I expected"
"1130","I love my kindle!!!"
"1131","Oh my gosh, I am in love!!!!  I always assumed that a multifunction tablet would be more useful, but being a reader and dad of teenage daughters, I never know where my tablet is!  Since my kindle is a reader, not a gaming/ email/ video device, nobody in my household cares about it....BUT I DO!!!!!It is easy on my eyes, and I am so glad, I now have access to the KINDLE LENDING LIBRARY!!!!YES...if you've never had a Kindle...and you are a reader...YOU GOTTA GET A KINDLE!!!!"
"1132","OMG! I love my kindle.Don't waste your extra money to remove ads. It only display one ad when you open the book. Just swipe and read. It does not show finger prints and you can read it very well in the light and outdoors (even in the sun). Can't read in the dark unless you buy the light attachment separately."
"1133","If you like to read, just read some books, this is the best simple reading tool for you.  Long battery life, simple to use, and a lot of free book to down load from Amazon.  The only thing I can complain about it is, you need to turn on the light to read, which can be solved easily by adding a mini clip-on light."
"1134","The new and improved 6' Kindle is great , I have an I pad, but this kindle is so much better for reading. I can read for hours with the kindle, but when reading with other devices my eyes get tired. I can't believe they can make a reader this good for such a reasonable price.  If I could not purchase another ,  I would not take $1,000 for mine."
"1135","when the offer ends?"
"1136","Easy to read outside"
"1137","Best gift ever given"
"1138","I can't tell if I've already read the book until I click on it"
"1139","switched for paperwhite...way too dark...spend the extra money"
"1140","I do wish I would have paid just a little extra for the paperwhite but this is still good. It's a little heavy and thick in my opinion. I feel like it could definitely be thinner considering our 7th generation that we had for years was about 1/3 of the thickness. I'm sure it has something to do with being touch screen. I don't know. It gets the job done though."
"1141","I bought this for my nine year old daughter for her birthday.  In our tech savy family, we already have thirteen devices between Kindle Fire, phones, iPads, computers, gaming systems, etc with internet, the last thing she needed was another distraction (for the record, these are my husband's and my devices and while it seems like a lot, we are not glued to screens all day).  We are stationed overseas and it's not easy to get books in English here and she has quite an extensive reading list for summer.  This is exactly what she needed.  The screen is clear, it is very easy for her to navigate, the dictionary feature is fantastic and she can read quietly in her room at night with her booklight.  She has been a fairly avid reader but now I can't keep get her to put her kindle down, which makes me a very happy mom.  I had to use chat with customer service for a setup issue and they had everything taken care of for us within a few minutes.  Great product and great support."
"1142","I love this e-reader. It may not be as fancy as the paperwhite, or the latest e-reader from Amazon kindle, but it does what I'd expect any e-reader to do: allow me to read books conveniently all on one device. The battery life is great, I've had it for over a month and it still hasn't run out of charge. With a price that is nearly 2/3 the price of the paperwhite, it's a good investment for new users of e-readers."
"1143","I do most of my reading during my commute on the New York subway, and on the LIRR. The last few years it has been easier to just play a game on my iPhone, while I stand in a crowded train. Flipping pages while holding on to a pole in a moving train is awkward.Since I got my kindle (originally I bought it for the wife) I have been reading every day, and finishing books faster than I ever used to. I love it."
"1144","Am enjoying the Kindle just received. I believe they called it a ""paperwhite"" but couldn't find out much from the customer service department.  I am replacing one of the original models, ordered years ago and broken and replaced three times. This is my fourth, then. The third was indestructible until it fell into the pool. Hopefully this one will remain usable for years to come. My disappointment comes concerning the price of these older models charged to a loyal multiyear paying customer expecting a discounted price."
"1145","Love the touch screen"
"1146","Has worked very well"
"1147","One of the best products out there and well worth the price! The only problem is that it's not very PDF friendly. I already had many PDF books, and it's hard to read them on this device if the pages are fairly large. Resizing of PDF documents is not possible, or at least I haven't figured it out yet."
"1148","I use well in china ."
"1149","It's great,I love it."
"1150","My daughter loves it!"
"1151","Love the touchscreen."
"1152","Great for outside use."
"1153","Got this after my old one took a dip in my kitchen sink. I am very pleased with this model Kindle. The screen contrast is excellent and easy on the eyes. Highlighting, word lookup and font changes are quick and easy. WiFi hookup is simple, with WPS. Library downloads work well. The unit seems physically thicker and more robust than the previous version. I got the ""ads"" model, but they are unobtrusive and only appear when the unit is shut off. The only two small nits I can pick are, the touch screen is a little too sensitive, so in many cases I actually prefer having the buttons from the old version, but I am getting used to it. And, having to swipe the screen to begin reading is annoying; if the passcode option isn't selected, there should be an option to skip the swipe. Other than those two minor things, this is an good bargain on a great reading device."
"1154","I bought it for a gift"
"1155","Absolutely love my Kindle! Given to me as a birthday gift from my 2 nieces and I've had to discipline myself to keep my nose out of the latest book I've downloaded! I love the various features, especially the ability to highlight a word to get the exact definition if I don't recognize it and the ability to bookmark pages. I highly recommend this Kindle."
"1156","This is our 4th Kindle and cannot say I am impressed with any of them. While they work, everything is great. However, each of the Kindles have just stopped working after just a few months and needed to be replaced. The first three were 2nd generation Kindles. The first one lasted 8 months before it froze up and no longer worked. Since it was under warranty, they sent a new one at no cost. The second one lasted nearly 6 months before it wouldn't turn on at all. Since it was a replacement the warranty was only 6 months instead of one year so we barely got a new one under the 6 month warranty. The 3rd one they sent us came with no warranty at all and quit working within 7 months. So, we decided to not purchase another one for 2 years. Then at Christmas in 2014 we thought we would give it another try for a family member...BIG MISTAKE! It is only the end of April and this Kindle has already quit working. They replaced it for free under the 1 year warranty. Thank God we bought an addition 2 year warranty at the time of purchase.We are very UNHAPPY with the 2 different Kindle devices we have tried (4 Kindles total) and would not recommend spending the money on it. If you like to read from Kindle, download the app. It works like a charm on my phone and tablet."
"1157","It gets the job done."
"1158","Love this Kindle!  I bought this for my wife.  I have the older version and she has this newer one.  Very easy to use and the screen is awesome.  I can't believe you can get a Kindle for such a low price!"
"1159","Easy to use. I love it."
"1160","Best ever!...3rd Kindle"
"1161","Good price for quality."
"1162","This basic Kindle is exactly what I hoped it would be.  Before selecting this, I compared it to the features of other Kindles, and realized I didn't need all the bells and whistles.  I got it with the special offers, and as soon as I click on Home the offers go away.  Not a problem for me.  It is easy to operate and easy to read."
"1163","Very nice for its price"
"1164","Nice product but returned it for paperwhite version because I'm an idiot and didn't know that this version doesn't have a backlight.  I know they say you shouldn't read just before bed with an illuminated screen, but it's the only time I have when my wife is asleep."
"1165","...a wonderful piece of technology.- The technology behind the screen makes the reading feel more like paper.- Changing from page to page is simple and fast.- The battery life is extremely long.It also might helpt to mention that the size of this device makes it especially exquisite for me due to the resizing of pages to the (not so) small screen that gives you a better feeling of advancement (I have a problem with big books where the pages contain small letters and long descriptions, which makes me feel a bit frustrated by thinking about how the book will continue to be like this, and gets on my nerves).I bought this device on a special to try it out, and I'm glad I did."
"1166","Easy to set and handle"
"1167","I love my Kindle! There is a little scratch in the screen so it's a black spot.  But I have 80 books on it and it doesn't hurt my eyes,  I have a lot of eye problems. It's super light and I can bring it anywhere."
"1168","I really like my kindle, this is the second kindle I have bought.  Love them"
"1169","I  LOVE  IT  WORK  GOOD"
"1170","It met the expectation."
"1171","great deal on a great product, however, I now wish I had the one with the ability to background light so that I could read in bed without disturbing my husband.  The size and weight of this product is wonderful as I can easily slip into my handbag without worry.  Therefore I am reading much more."
"1172","The paper white screen is as easy to read as a printed book.  Sometimes reading from a computer monitor strains my eyes but the Kindle does not do this.  I am very pleased with it and would recommend it to any one."
"1173","I was debating on getting the basic kindle or the paperwhite kindle. So i went into best buy and saw the little difference between the two The paperwhite has a backlight for night time reading and a slightly higher resolution but thats all. If you want to spend 40 more bucks for a light that you can simply turn on a lamp or get a clip on light for less than five bucks and the reolution isnt a big deal if you are reading books because most of the time its not like your going to zoom all the in. So if you just willing to do 40 more bucks just for a backlight then be my guest but the basic kindle is a bang for the buck it even has the anti glare screen which is amazing but it all depends on the person if they like the fancier version thats seems to me like a waste ot 40 bucks that you can buy a couple books with."
"1174","I honestly was hesitant to ever switch to an electronic device. I love my paperback books, but this is awesome. No driving to the store or waiting on the mail to be delivered. I just search and buy. It's pretty clear and easy to ready as well. Might even get a Kindle Fire for the hubby."
"1175","Great product to readers"
"1176","Good size and so far so good- just got it last week but I was able to sync it with my existing Kindle account after my old kindle died.  I'm very happy with this so far.  Easy to use and clear menu bars and prompts."
"1177","I reviewed this already."
"1178","I LOVE MY NEW. KINDLE  Q"
"1179","This suited all of my needs, great product, low price and easy to use.  I have a top of the line tablet I use for ebooks, but have problems seeing the display in sunlight.  The screen on this product can be seen in the brightest conditions.  I definintly recommend this to people that read a lot of books"
"1180","So far I have enjoyed it"
"1181","I really love my kindle!"
"1182","Disappointed that none of the 4 I purchased have the backlight.  My previous Kindle was a replacement for the first generation. I elected the Kindle Paperwhite as a refurbished replacement, & it had the backlight.  I failed to note that the new purchases do not have the backlight! !And that light being the only difference, I find it shocking that there is a $40 price difference!!So much til next time, as I've only made two years on my previous 2.  The 4 I just purchases were for my spouse & grandsons & myself"
"1183","really disappointed in this product that I shipped to my mailbox & then to UAE (Dubai) - the screen definitely has issues. the screen keeps twitching & each time I load a new page it takes time to display clearly. it turns all black, then all white... horrible experience!"
"1184","I absolutely love it!  I have the original kindle still but this one can fit in even my smallest purse. I'm visually impaired so I was apprehensive if I would be able to read the type & I can see it just fine!  Great purchase, great price & fantastic product!"
"1185","THE UNIT IS GREAT.  THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT ACCOMPANIED IT ARE AMONG THE WORST I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED WHICH THEN REQUIRED A COUPLE CALLS TO KINDLE SUPPORT (THE PEOPLE WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE KNEW NOTHING, THE SUPERVISOR I EVENTUALLY REQUESTED TO SPEAK WITH WAS TERRIFIC. GREAT HELP.)  ALL WORKING JUST FINE NOW."
"1186","For being an ebook reader, I'm very happy with this device. I got it on sale for $60 and it does exactly what I want out of ebook reader - it lets me read books and has a good battery life. I'm still disappointed that Kindles don't natively support epub format but that's Amazon's fault, not the Kindle. My previous Kindle, and my wife's (both Kindle Keyboards) started freezing up after a couple years so I couldn't unlock it apart from a device reboot, and from searching online it seems it could be down to the battery, so only time will tell if this Kindle suffers a similar fate down the line. As of right now though, it does the job, and the ads only appear on the unlock screen so don't intrude on reading - I'm happy with the discounted price for an inconvenience I don't even notice."
"1187","I had high expectations, and I realize that for fifty bucks I shouldn't have. The screen is not white like in the picture, more like grey. When you turn the page there's no fancy animation, just a black flash of the screen and then you're on the next page. Doesn't work with all books. I bought it for college, and my hope was to read my Java textbook with it because the physical book is HUGE... Couldn't read it because it wasn't compatible. I figure that's because of the pictures in the book. Does not display any color, and you can't read at all in the dark. Battery life is amazing, I'll give it that. Left it on for weeks and it was still running. If you want to just read basic books with no pictures in them, and aren't expecting actual tablet quality, this works just fine. If you want to read something with pictures in it... it may not be compatible. Don't buy with high expectations. It's pretty slow and blinks at you when you try to do anything with it. But, you can read books with it. Just didn't fit my purpose. Luckily it's only fifty bucks so I'm not super mad."
"1188","havent quite decided yet"
"1189","Fantastic.  Use it daily"
"1190","Perfect for my needs.  I purchased on Black Friday for $49, and knew what I was getting.  It's light and uncomplicated, and I've found it to be well worth the money.  There are some times I wished I had a light, but for $49, I can't complain.  It's my 3rd Kindle, and they've come a long way since the old days!!  I just wanted something light and easy to throw in my bag."
"1191","Still getting use to it.  Don't like the idea that if I have a problem trying to figure out some function, I have to locate the on-line manual, try to remember what I read, then continuing to try to solve the problem.  I need a guide to follow alone with problem solving. Amazon should offer a printed manual with each reader."
"1192","Nice. Protects the reader"
"1193","makes reading so much fun"
"1194","Amazing Product i LOVE IT"
"1195","Never leave have without."
"1196","Touch interface is not what you'd expect from a modern touchscreen and less practical than the old buttons. User Experience and navigation should be completely rethought. Quality of graphics is poor. Zoom is useless for graphics."
"1197","I got this as an early Christmas gift from my mother. At first, I was disappointed because I was expecting to get the Paperwhite version. But this quickly grew on me. I actually prefer not having a glaring white lit background while reading. This is much more akin to what an actual page out of a book might look like. I love that I can easily hold this in one hand and read, depending on my sitting position. Even though my hands are small, it still fits comfortably for me. I have had this for about a week and a half, maybe two weeks and I've already zipped through a few books. I'm very happy with this! If you're trying to decide between the Paperwhite or getting this version, just get this one! It works just the same as the other one, and you aren't really missing out on any special features."
"1198","I was always one of those people who wanted the book in hand and then read it and put it on the shelves.  Then I started checking prices on book from amazon and a lot of the books I wanted were free or the most expensive one were 1.99 and for the price I paid for the kindle I just couldn't pass it up."
"1199","I'm amazed with my Kindle!"
"1200","This description is misleading- I thought it adjusted to the ambient room light based on the description... ""Same brightness as the room""... This device does not actually have a light adjustable screen."
"1201","Having problems with the Kindle as I can't find any books that it supports for free."
"1202","I always want to read some books before I sleep, now I can do it with my kindle, not using my cell phone and read all those junks.  At the very beginning, I struggled whether I should buy the paperwhite, but I finally chose this model due to the much lower price.  I thought I don't need a higher resolution.  At the end, I think I missed a key feature from this basic model, LED light.  I like to read something before I sleep and I don't like  to turn on the light, so I need to do it if I want to read with my Kindle now...but paying $40 to upgrade to Paperwhite for the LED light...I really don't know."
"1203","Registering the kindle was really easy as I had had a previous one.  That eased a lot of my fears.  The written instructions are simple and easy to follow.  However, the manual on using it is only in the cloud (you can download it).  That means you need to experiment quite a bit to get to it.  I would have preferred a basic manual in writing.  It's easy to read and light weight."
"1204","I have been wanting to own a Kindle for yrs, but never purchased one.This was a recent purchase for myself as a Christmas gift. After reading the reviews, the Kindle e-reader would meet my needs. I absolutely love my new Kindle...👍"
"1205","Touch screen not as sensitive as I'd like, but overall seems to work well. Searching for books on it can be painful with the touch and scrolling.Amazon, when I type in something like ""The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland Free"" or ""Through the Looking Glass Free"", why are the free books buried deep down? There should be a ""sort by price"" option maybe? But ya, it can be hard to find the Free books on."
"1206","I really like it but there isn't a light like my cell phone so I can read it in the dark"
"1207","We didn't like this version of the kindle at all! Very hard to use! Finally returned it!"
"1208","is seems a little underbuilt. like a chaep toy. and its hard to read in low like situations. otherwise its great! i love the touchscreen, and its longer (seriously) battery life really kicks ass! overall im pleased with my purchase."
"1209","Not working with 5GHZ WIFI"
"1210","love it we have two in use"
"1211","Amazon has a ""great"" team of customer service, that can pass a customer's one simple question to numerous people for 2 hours and still can not offer even one moronic solution. Given this experience it is really doubtful Kindle is worth its high price. No matter what version of Kindle you purchase, once you've encountered their customer service when you need help, you will know what a nightmare is !"
"1212","Received broken returned it"
"1213","Excellent buy. Works great."
"1214","It depends on the paperback"
"1215","Amazing reading experience!"
"1216","Disappointed... I have a really old first generation Kindle that I LOVE. I bought this one for my 10 year old, who loves to read. When I opened the box, I noticed that it was made of much cheaper plastic. I soon realized that there was no sound or headphone port to use for audio books. I also discovered that, unlike my nearly 5 year old Kindle, I could not add any games (all I wanted was a Scrabble or word search game.) As it was a Christmas gift, I could not return this (And I would have!!) All I wanted was a reading device, with a couple bells and whistles (the option of an advanced reading audio book or a word game)... This delivered none. He loves it, but I am disappointed!"
"1217","It's light to hold and not hard on my wrists. I have carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists, and I bought this to read in bed at night. It's perfect! And the non-glare screen makes it so much easier to read outside. I also wanted the view to be more like a physical book since colorful, active screens stimulate the brain and can be a cause of insomnia. I also love that I can change the font size. I give it a 10 out of 10!"
"1218","Wasn't sure how it was going to fare over paperback, but I love it. A little guy, well put together and engineered. Fits right in my hand, and the plastic has a nice tactile feel.  Even the unboxing experience is pretty cool."
"1219","I bought this Kindle for my Dad who is 84 and loves it!  He has never used a computer or any other electronic devices but the touchscreen on this Kindle made it quick & easy for him to master.  Turning the pages of a regular book had become hard because he has a tremor, but with the Kindle he can read with ease and total enjoyment.  We are both thrilled with how much he is using and enjoying this Kindle!"
"1220","Absolutely LOVE this!!! It does everything is says it does. And if you're looking for a basic ereader and nothing over the top fancy this is for you! My husband bought it for me as a gift for my birthday since it went on a SUPER good sale and it came EXTREMELY fast!!! Love everything about it!! If you're looking for a case OMOTON has several pretty awesome designs to choose from and are great quality but won't break the bank!!"
"1221","Just started using it. I am slowly learning how to navigate it.  I think if it hadn't been given to me as a birthday present by my step son I would probably stick with hard copy books.  I appreciate that the Kindle is compact and is essentially a library at your finger tips, but I read 2 - 4 books a week and find comfort in falling asleep with a good book in my lap.  :-)I intend to keep experimenting with the Kindle in order to get adjusted to its capabilities."
"1222","Very difficult to negotiate."
"1223","Excellent, great adquisition"
"1224","It was a little difficult to get used to the touchscreen after owning a keyboard Kindle, but I expected that. I do like the fact that it weighs less than my old one. I haven't had it long enough to do a real review of all it's features, but it does have more of them than my old one and I like the fact that I can switch back and forth between the two and my computers without losing my place."
"1225","I am very happy - now. The first few days were stressful. I was showing my wife how to use it and, as soon as she touched it, it froze. It would not respond to anything except a LONG power off. I almost returned it.  But, I have read several books since then without problem and prefer it to my Fire - based on weight alone."
"1226","Great for outside reading and much lighter than HD one I have. I  use HD one as an audio book listener and this one for reading. It would be great if it had some kind of light for darker rooms/rainy days."
"1227","This is a great little gadget.  For starters, it produces NO light...  especially the blue tones, which are proven to interfere with later efforts to sleep.  Of course, that means that you can only read when there's light available. It's light in weight...  probably about the same as a paperback book and it's similar in size to a paperback.  Best of all, it looks like its battery lasts in excess of a week.  I couldn't be more pleased!"
"1228","Not at all a bad e reader. Having owned several kindles in the past, this was comparable to one of my earliest models. The features are cool, but reading is reading for the most part. I returned mine ONLY because I do need a backlight. I read in the dark-- often until I pass out. Reaching to shut off my lamp is annoying. So lazy-- I know! If you don't mind needing a light on to read at night, this kindle is perfectly acceptable. I am ordering another paper white so I can have my back light back. (my last one had a pixel go out and I couldn't get past looking at it). All are on sale right now, so the deals are good."
"1229","I was pleased and satisfied ."
"1230","Not a big fan of the no light"
"1231","This is a great new innovation to the Kindle series. This is my fourth Kindle.  Two have failed and I was ready to try a touch screen.  It is smaller and thus easier to carry, but Amazon has done a great improvement over the former touch screen technology."
"1232","Did not come with a usb cable"
"1233","I cannot figure out how to turn it on.  All I can get are the book ads.  It asks me for a password which I have never given it.  Nor will it let me give  password. I'm looking for some help with this and not finding it on line.  It is useless to me until someone can tell me how to turn it on and get something loaded on it that I can read."
"1234","I almost sent it back the day I got it because it was so hard to turn on. I downloaded info as have others from the internet but iit was still glitchy. It takes a long time to boot up and the screen is so dim that even with light and large font it's hard to read. I am so so sorry I bought this.I am a huge fan of kindle in general. My really old one still works more or less and it's so much better than this one that Kindle should be ashamed.Don't buy it."
"1235","I like this kindle much better than my Kindle fire.  (I have an older version of the Kindle Fire).  I had the very first kindle e-reader, and this one is very similar.  Light to hold, and great for sunlight etc.  I only wish it did light up for night reading.  With that said, I use this one for daytime and my fire for night time reading."
"1236","I have an IPad so I didn't know how I would feel about the Kindle, but thought I would pick one up on sale and take it to the beach. You can read the Kindle in any kind of light with ease. The controls and features are very intuitive and easy to use. The Amazon library of books is huge. I found that the Kindle and the IPad are not the same animals and that having one does not exclude the other!"
"1237","Great for reading by the pool!"
"1238","Shipment fast, so far so good"
"1239","I had been wanting a Kindle reader for quite awhile and when it went on sale for $49 I couldn't resist!  I have a Kindle Fire tablet, but I always found it too heavy for comfortable reading.  This new Kindle is very light and easy to carry and hold.  I'm actually reading books again!"
"1240","I really liked this. It's very easy to use. Plus the weight is really light and I can make the text bigger. Plus I can get my books a lot easier than I thought. The only thing I don't like is that I have to go into a Wi-Fi Hot Spot...but other than that it's very good."
"1241","I was hesitant to get an e-book reader, but I read a lot and the books were taking up too much space in our house. My husband suggested we try the kindle and I LOVE it. I have been reading more because downloading books is so easy. The battery life is awesome - which was one of my hesitations about buying the reader."
"1242","This little baby has single-handedly kindled (pun intended) my daughter's desire to read. It's a great morphing of the kindle paperwhite and the Fire.  Great for encouraging reading without getting a bunch of internet gadgets you don't want a younger child to putz with."
"1243","I love the Kindle. I just needed something to read on, without other bells and whistles of tablets like the iPad. Works well and if you just need an e-reader and not the other functions of a full tablet, then this is for you.Battery life is also long, unlike tablets. I can ready for 4-5 hours a night and it will last almost 2 weeks."
"1244","Great reading tool that makes my life much easier! This kindle is great for reading, even better than my iPad. It is really easy on my eyes since it has the same brightness as my surrounding. The battery is amazing because I can charge it once for a month of reading. The Word Wise feature is also great for reading harder books since it automatically translate difficult vocabulary into simple definitions. I would definitely recommend it and buy another one for my kids."
"1245","Screen is crap. When I flip the pages it stutters and is not smooth. It takes a bit before the words on the page are even readable. If I could return it I would. Just bought it black Friday online from staples. Its not returnable after you open it and put books on to try it out. Spend your money elsewhere."
"1246","Very pleased with this item...x"
"1247","Dark screen.  Have tried everything to brighten, but geeez....Just tell us that this one is terrible and to get the Paperwhite, Amazon.  I THOUGHT I got a good deal, but now have to return and get a REAL reader.  DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS."
"1248","Just got my new kindle two days ago. Much better than reading books on the iPhone! I like it a lot, but don't like that I can't read it in the dark! Didn't realize this version doesn't have a built in light and I can't change the display to a black screen with white letters to read in lower light."
"1249","I am so far pleased with the 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen. I love the size and light weight because it makes it so much easier to carry it in my handbag when ever I go out and also when I travel on a trip. I still have to get use to it and learn a few more things about it.  Of course I made a great purchase and saved a lot of money when I bought it on the big sale day."
"1250","My Kindle of many years was broken and not repairable. I ordered a new one and it is awesome. No buttons, totally touch screen, I like it. (I reserve ""love"" for living beings.)  It was refurbished, but looks flawless. I would not hesitate to purchase again. If you have no Kindle, buy one."
"1251","I do like the Kindle very much."
"1252","Love it .  Easy to use and safe"
"1253","Its a great product.. Perfect.."
"1254","I already had a 1st generation Kindle, but I was having a problem now and then. My wife surprised me with the Kindle 6"" for no reason. I have used it exclusively since I got it and I love it. Next will be the Kindle Fire like she has."
"1255","Love this item! I received this as an early Christmas present from my husband as he knows I love to read. I've had it a couple weeks and it especially has been helpful in getting my daily time in reading the Bible and having easy access to read is so nice because I for the last few years have been reading books on my pc for kindle. I had a little learning curve with making sure to buy books that work with kindle as I got a sudoku one thinking it'd let me play on touchscreen - hah nope. That's okay I returned that book, lol. Thank you for this affordable and good quality device!"
"1256","This was ordered to replace one I had ""lost"" or so I thought.  The day after this one arrived, I found the old one.  Since I like it so much, I decided to keep both.  I would encourage anyone who loves to read to get this one."
"1257","I had to replace my old kindle.  So I just received it a couple of days ago, but far so good, though.  The only thing I think is missing is the audio reader.  Maybe I just have not located the feature yet.  But other than that, I am pleased with the smaller size and touch screen."
"1258","I'm loving the light weight and easy to hold nature of it. Even though I own an iPad, a iPhone, and the first kindle fire, I found that I needed to be able to read without light shining in my eyes, and without glare. It was priced affordably.  I've since enjoyed many hours of reading."
"1259","It's great! Just wish it lit up."
"1260","I love it, so easy to take along"
"1261","Love that I can read it outside!"
"1262","It dosent work aND i will never purchased from amazon again. i will be sending it back ASAP!THANK YOU"
"1263","No instruction manual included."
"1264","I was one of those people that promised myself to never buy one of these things, but I had to acquire one to get affordable versions of my expensive college books. Now that I have one I wish that I had invested in them years ago. I would've save so much on my college books alone, not to mention my own personal library. The only negative thing is have to say about this kindle is that you can't read in the dark and that seems a little rediculous sense this is essentially a small tablet and we already have that technology."
"1265","It doesnt unlock everytime I leave it for a while. Even ""slide to unlock"" screen doesn't come back. Stuck on the lockscreen ad. Total reboot is the only way I can get in. I tried factory reset, no help."
"1266","It's fine. I just liked my Kindle w/ buttons better. It is very difficult to get back to screen where you search etc. after you have finished a book. And I have yet to figure out if you can view archived items. When I go to buy a book,that I know I have already purchased, it tells me I have already purchased it but does not have a place where I can view archived items (that I can find) like my Kindle w/ buttons."
"1267","I bought this to replace my original Kindle, which finally gave out.  I had some misgivings based on the less-then-five-star reviews I read but couldn't be more pleased with my decision.  Everything works and the screen is easy to read.  Love my Kindle!"
"1268","This is my first E-Reader and it has really made  me to get into reading again. I find the screen to be easier on the eyes then the Kindle Android app or Kindle Fire which my wife has. I don't read in bed, so there is no need for a back light such as the Paper White. Set up was quick and there isn't much of a learning curve. If you have a smartphone, you shouldn't have any issues operating the Kindle.  For $59 I am very happy with Kindle Glare Free and have already read a couple of novels on it."
"1269","My wife is always reading so I grabbed her the kindle for the sake of time and convenience.  You won't find a better product for a better price.  ""How much did you spend!"" I was asked.  ""Not as much as you think I did.""  Don't get me wrong, I love books.  The tangibility, the smell (yes, I know) the shelf that collects new works and old classics, but when she can't fit a John Sandford hardback in her purse, she certainly can fit that kindle in.^ that should sell the kindle itself.Buy with confidence, it's a great product.  What would make it better and 5 stars?  A backlight.  For those who read in bed."
"1270","I love it, so easy to see and read"
"1271","So easy to buy books from amazon!"
"1272","love the kindle --great product!"
"1273","The feel of the unit is somewhat light and ""cheap"". It does what it is supposed to do by allowing you to read the e-books but the processing power behind it feels a little slow. Some menus are slow to load, slight lag in between screens."
"1274","I bought this for my daughter and she didn't like it, she already had kindle fire before but got broken so I bought this, but she said that its ok to read but fire was easier to read.but she already has laptop and smartphone so for me she don't need any internet on kindle so I love the price.over all I loved the price. so I give 4 star."
"1275","So far I loveeeed it. I used to haver the old paperwhite version, and I loved the smaller size and touch screen. The possibility of family sharing is also great since I can get the books I used to have in my old Kindle in this new device! I highly recommend!!!!"
"1276","Probably the best thing I have ever bought for myself. I love love love this reader! I don't mind the special offers at all since they don't interfere with the books I'm reading while I'm in them. If you love to read, do yourself a favor and pick this up. No regrets whatsoever. :)"
"1277","I prefer the ease of navigation on my ipad vs the kindle. I wanted to take for travel books and found it a challenge to flip around between the pages. Hated not having a good zoom function and prefer the color on my ipad. It was not very touch sensitive either.My mother loves her kindle for book reading so don't let me comments deter you. Best part is it's ability to hold a charge. It's pretty incredible."
"1278","It's much lighter to carry in my purse than the Fire HD 7"" however the ""collections"" option is in need of an upgrade.  I had the keyboard model several years back and when a book was put in a ""collection"" it didn't appear anywhere except there.  On this model, it still appears in ""books"" as well as the ""collection"" you filed it under.  This was a great option since not all books go into a collection it would much easier to organize your books and/or collections.  Once it's moved to a collection it should no longer appear under books.  When I first started using this model it seemed a little difficult to turn the pages but I've since learned that if you ""tap"" the center of the screen it will turn to the next page."
"1279","Did not realize that I  would not be able to brighten the screen  at all...  so now I  have ordered a  light for it"
"1280","How do I cancel Unlimited Reading?"
"1281","Glad I have it Everything I wanted"
"1282","great little device! a back light would be good now and then. I was able to upload a number of PDF files, or books. They must be loaded into the DOCUMENTS folder on the Kindle, then they show on your book menu."
"1283","I hesitated for a long time to buy a Kindle as I love real books. So when I finally took the plunge I was pleasantly surprised. I love that my Kindle is lightweight, easy to carry and stores many books in a tiny space. Its non-glare screen makes outdoor viewing very easy, and on windy days I can read hands free whilst eating lunch, without having to worry about pages being turned. It never loses my place, i can bookmark passages easily and highlight text if needed. If I'm reading the book on more than one device, it will sync to the furtherest page read. The device holds a charge for weeks. The only drawback is the inability to read the screen in a darkened room. For that I have a tablet and use the Kindle app for android, but I cannot read the tablet in broad daylight."
"1284","Some of these ""did you read the description??"" reviews are a bit harsh, considering that many people drawn to a low-cost e-reader may have never purchased one before, and don't really know what to look for.  Such was the case with my husband who got this for me for Christmas. I wanted an e-reader so I could read a book without being interrupted by texts and other notifications popping up on my screen (without having to mess with my phone's settings every time I stopped and started reading) and so I could read in bed without turning on a lamp or draining my phone battery.  Having zero experience with designated e-readers, my husband thought they'd all be like my daughter's iPad, or our phones: lit.  This is not. You can read from this Kindle under the same conditions you can read from an actual book.  No reading without the bedside lamp. So that in itself was a deal-breaker for me, but some other impressions I had: this thing is so lightweight, I love that about it! Also, the dictionary and character bio features are awesome. I can't tell you how many times I'll be reading a book, and someone who disappeared in Chapter 2 comes back in Chapter 12, and I have to go flipping back to Chapter 2 to remind myself who he is.  For the negative though, coming from the Kindle and Nook apps for iPhone, I love their animated page turns.  You don't get that with a ""real"" Kindle.  For video editors out there, the effect is comparable to a one-second cross-disolve. It's something I'd get used to, but it felt strange at first.  But I never did get the hang of paging through my library. Sometimes it would lag, sometimes it would flip perfectly, other times I had to try to flip three or four times. Strange.  This device also has no kind of contrast control.  Not-quite-pure-black type on a gray page is a little tough to read, but you get what you get.  I do a lot of graphics work, and the slightly bitmapped appearance of some of the larger images/icons on the page bothered me a lot, but I'm betting most people wouldn't notice or care.So, if you know what you're looking for and understand what you're getting here -- a simple e-reader without any kind of backlight/front-light, whatever, my guess is that you'll be perfectly happy, because that's what this is.  But if you've been using a Kindle or Nook app on a tablet or phone, know that this is different. It seems like the Kindle Paperwhite is more of what I'm looking for, so I'll try to convince the hubby to upgrade. :-)"
"1285","Good product,Great Amazon service."
"1286","This is my second Kindle.  I love the smaller size and lighter weight.  The touch screen was easy to get used to.  My first Kindle was over five years old.  This new one has many more features and conveniences."
"1287","I'm totally enjoying my Kindle. I only have one regret... that I didn't purchase it sooner. I've cleared out my hardcover library and am enjoying the extra space. A great device. I just wish that it came with step by step operating instructions and a better user's guide. I'm still trying to figure out how to do stuff and that's AFTER reading the owners manual they provided."
"1288","Kindle for me the best to read !!!"
"1289","I Love this!!!  It is my 4th Kindle, and I purchased it simply for travel, dr. visits, all those things that you hurry up and go to then sit and wait......It is well worth the cost. I have a kindle fire as well that I love, my original kindle has the page turn buttons on the side. I love both and use both. This is actually much more simple and easy to use for me, one handed, riding a bike......but I still love my old one as well. I don't like carrying my kindle fire every where I go, this was an inexpensive way to have something small and lightweight always with me in my purse so I can read whenever I have that few extra moments. It sets up quickly with no problems, easy to use instructions walk you step by step. Very happy wth this purchase!!!"
"1290","The screen is too sensitive.  Every time I touch any part of the the screen lightly by accident all sorts of windows pop up.  I like the first kindle better.  Also, the edge is very thin and it's hard to hold it without getting a hand cramp."
"1291","I love my new e-reader, I have a Nook but it is old and does not want to turn the page like it use to. The Nook was really driving me crazy and this was such a good deal I could not pass it up. They had it for 49.00 around Christmas time, so why not. Saved some money and my sanity."
"1292","The package came with a tight plastic wrap around it that was full of dirt or sand. It's really kinda gross, how am I supposed to wrap this up and give it to someone. I can't belive someone actually shipped this crap to me. It looks like they dug it up out of a sand box. It's too close to christmas to exchange."
"1293","Didn't know it was black and white and to hard go to home screen if you were reading anything and the games dont work."
"1294","The big problem with this edition of the Kindle is there is no backlighting of the screen which makes it impossible to use at night without another light source and very difficult to use in the daylight outside.  My Kindle is much older and has this feature  (backlighting/changing the color of the screen and letters) which makes it possible to read at night in bed without disturbing my wife and living in Florida it is a valuable feature when I take my Kindle to the beach.  Please don't issue another new Kindle that will not include backlighting."
"1295","too dark with no back light setting to adjust.  Hard on my eyes. maybe i received a bum one.  I will be returning it."
"1296","I am in love with my Kindle. Basic and just for reading which is all I wanted. I didn't want a tablet because I felt I would play games and get on the Internet so this is exactly what I wanted. I've had it for a few weeks and haven't charged it since I got it and I read at least 3 hours a day. I bought the $79.99 one with the advertisements and I actually really like it. I found my book light and cover via those advertisements. Also, love that you can go on Goodreads and get a free trial of Kindle Unlimited (which I will keep after th trial is over). Overall, it's the best buy I've made in a long time."
"1297","This is my first kindle I'm not overly impressed with it.  I tried the paperwhite first, but the light, even when turned all the way down, was giving me migraines whenever I read on it.  I then bought this kindle and I still get slight headaches reading on it.  I'm very surprised this has 167 ppi.  I have a first generation (2010) nook that has the same 167 ppi.  I would have thought after 4 years, the ppi would be better.  The nook's have continued to be upgraded with each new release, while this basic kindle version doesn't?  I'm really not fond of the touch screen either, I would prefer actual page turning buttons.  The power on button at the bottom is weird.  I can already imagine all the crumbs and dirt that will be stuck in the button from being in my purse.  The power on button should be at the top.  The very plastic edge and back have no grippers or anything to hold on to it with if you buy it without a case to try it out.  It is a little slippery and I actually dropped it a few times because it slipped out of my hands.  Once in a case, it's fine.  I also think the background color is too dark.  My 2010 nook is still the better of the two to read on."
"1298","I go everywhere with Kindle, and the old Kindle had just died.  So a friend bought this one for my birthday.  For the first three days I sooooo, loved it, but than the thing won't turn on, won't do a thing.  I had to wait til the next day to get to a computer to find out how to fix this issue.  When they send out this unit it should have a trouble shoot book sheet in with it.  Because I have heard from a few people that this is a common issue."
"1299","My husband loved his Christmas gift!"
"1300","Great reader, and very easy too use."
"1301","I returned this.  I found the special offers confusing and there is no case option with a light - which I really wanted."
"1302","Instructions are horrible and the screen is so dark you can't always read it, depends how lit up room is. Disappointed!"
"1303","Too light. Doesn't feel like a book."
"1304","The touchpad is awful. Can't use it."
"1305","I find it difficult to activate the menu bar at the top. You need a tiny finger to activate the menu ribbon instead of the dictionary feature. also the free every word game I had on my previous 4 now broken  kindles (I am careless) has disappeared. I loved that game . Otherwise it is a nice readable screen."
"1306","I thought it had he baclight feature"
"1307","I actually enjoy reading with this Kindle, although I will admit I was prejudiced against it because I enjoy actual books. That said, my main complaint is how difficult it is to really move around in some books. The PC versions of Kindle are much more user friendly. Nevertheless, I recommend it for the dictionary feature and it is just fun to use and so small, yet legible and convenient. I bought it during black Friday sales, so the $49.00 price can't be beat."
"1308","Not as easy to use as one might think, but it lets me carry a ton of literature with a few ounces of weight, helping me to reduce the library-grade clutter in my house without giving up on reading altogether.  Clear screen, easy to read, decent software options. No night illumination."
"1309","I love the Kindle! It's easy to use!"
"1310","Great product, my daughter loves it."
"1311","A little slow and plastic cheap feeling, but light and small.  Battery life outstanding.  The device is a bit slow seeming, yet otherwise fine.  Kindle search is just getting more confusing every year, with my Prime and my Unlimited trial.  (Utter shock how limited the unlimited selections are in Science Fiction, for example.)  But I got this on sale for $60.  I got what I paid for, definitely."
"1312","REALLY LIKE IT, AND AT A GREAT PRICE!"
"1313","Can I trade it in for a higher model?"
"1314","Not as easy to use as Kindle HD Fi re"
"1315","Not good sorry I gave up my old one.."
"1316","Taking some getting used to.........."
"1317","My new Touchscreen Kindle is great.  It is easy to use, being similar to my older Kindle.  I like being able to change the font and the font size of letters.  The one problem I have is it is almost too sensitive.  I gently tap it to turn the page, a feature I like very much.  But if I'm not careful, the Kindle will turn several pages instead of one.  Also I get the dictionary  sometimes when I mean to turn the page.  I do like the dictionary feature, however.  The Kindle is a so fun to use, all these books at my fingertips, and I can get a new one in seconds.  Love it."
"1318","I love this reader.  Great price and easy to use.  You cannot go wrong with this reader.  Sony reader went out of business and I was stuck with a reader that I could not use any more.  I wish that I would have gotten this one in the beginning."
"1319","I looove my Kindle! Got it on sale for $60. So far it has mostly been an Anne of Green Gables machine but I have also read more free, marginally awful mysteries from the Kindle store than I care to remember. It's to books what the iPod was to music…you never stopped loving reading but the Kindle makes it really fun again.Technical details: reads just like a book. Never have to worry about glare. I have found myself wishing I had purchased the Paperwhite, just because I want to read in the dark and this Kindle doesn't come with a light, but ultimately it's not a huge deal for me. Maybe I'll upgrade in a few years."
"1320","I love the fact that Goodreads is now integrated in Kindle! It's now easier to mark and shelves books there without visiting the actual website. I also have the older version and I can see a lot of improvements in this latest model."
"1321","Good if you have some light. Not so good in the dark =) I know that sounds funny and for most people it is a no-brainer, however, some people don't get why you would pick up a Kindle Paperwhite.If you have some decent light (sun, lamps, office, starbucks...not in the dark, or other generally lit places) it works very well.  Still haven't had to recharge it and enjoy reading on it."
"1322","I've owned Kindles since the first generation.  Always loved them, prob always will.  I like the regular ereader because backlighting gives me headaches, and these look like paper but I can carry my whole library in my hand.  This new one is super light too.  Love it!"
"1323","Great present for my mom! She love it!"
"1324","Oh how I wish I had bought it ad free."
"1325","This is my second Kindle. I had a first generation kindle which had more  features than this one does  like page turning buttons and the ability to play audio books.  However I really like having something that is just for reading. It has functioned as advertised with long battery life and glare free screen."
"1326","I like work fine and is easy nto learn"
"1327","Smaller than I thought. But loving it."
"1328","Works very well. Wanted one for a long time and am very happy with the results. Easy to download books, long battery life, excellent view screen with no glare and very light weight. Would recommend ordering a protective cover to protect the unit."
"1329","only thing missing is light up sctreen"
"1330","I got this as a replacement for the older model.This model is awkward to hold, has a wide frame and is very thick. The touch screen is an okay but unnecessary addition."
"1331","Needs back light for reading at night."
"1332","Glitchy and battery does not last long."
"1333","It was a gift but she says she loves it"
"1334","Not as user friendly as the OLD style!!"
"1335","I can read books and order books off of Amazon.com, but it wasn't what I expected. Can't get emails or Facebook on this device. :O("
"1336","Awesome device for reading easy to use"
"1337","This is NOT the Kindle to get if you want to have 'apps' BUT it is a wonderful Kindle for the avid reader who prefers that their digital book look more like a real book! I love the fact that Goodreads website link came already installed on it b/c that is where I keep track of all my books and browse the possibilities of future readings!"
"1338","Can't sleep without this little machine"
"1339","Locks up and has to reboot on occasion."
"1340","Works great for the daily subway commute and if all you need is an e-reader then look no further.Gentleman -  This will fit in your suit jacket pockets. This is clutch if you don't carry a bag or want the hassle of holding it all the time."
"1341","It wasn't a bad little device until the latest software update. I will no longer use it, just chuck it in the junk drawer. Instead of having easy access to what I want, I now have to share the screen with suggestion, more suggestions, more; Junk, Tripe, Trivia. Oddly, I paid extra to get rid of the ads only to have the new software that I never asked for bring them back on steroids. Guess it was just too tempting for Mr. Bezos to honor the agreement of no ads. Of course he will say they are not ads, but recommendations. Why would I want a recommendation on my next book; I can't find the last one without using a blood hound. DO YOU GIVE REFUNDS on at least the part about the ""Ad Free"" version?"
"1342","Purchased 3 of these kindles and gave as presents, didn't get direct feedback from the receiver, but I believe his wife is enjoying one of them.  The other 2, not really sure, but for avid readers, its a great gift."
"1343","I LOVE my Kindle Fire but wanted to be able to read outside.  While this Kindle allows me to do this, I do not like the transitions.  I do not have a problem with turning the page--I do that on my Fire.  The transitions are not smooth.  Not a deal breaker since I only paid $49 but I wish the transitions were smoother.  I don't mind the ads either.  They are usually book suggestions, so they are not completely irrelevant."
"1344","Big improvement over my previous kindle."
"1345","I thought it was lighted. No back light."
"1346","Excellent reading unit. Glad I found it."
"1347","Difficult to read on due to no lighting."
"1348","I got my reader as a gift and I love it."
"1349","Great E-Reader.  Simple to use and nice."
"1350","Works great. Same touch interface as the Kindle app on my smartphone so very easy to figure out. Very nice to read Kindle books. Only drawback is that reading pdfs on it is nigh impossible, tho it does work fine for Amtrak tickets, hotel reservations, etc - just not reading."
"1351","It seems the ""designers"" are young people and do not understand or think senior citizens are interested in the Kindle.  The plastic surrounds is slippery & the on/off being black is very difficult to see. The format of books bought should be just shown as a list and not pictures of the book covers.The covers are again------- difficult to see.  BT"
"1352","I love my kindle, this my third one and I hate that they got rid of the buttons. My hair changes the page, and you have to do funky things with your fingers to get simple changes like font and the home screen."
"1353","Almost a perfect personal reading device."
"1354","Very lightweight and comfortable to hold."
"1355","Very clear display, lots of font options."
"1356","Exactly what I waned for a second Kindle."
"1357","Bought this as a gift for my fiancee. It is worth so much more than what it costs. She absolutely loves it. I have a Kindle Fire HD, and I can not imagine my life without a Kindle. Thank you Amazon for making such great products that allow us to enjoy reading anytime, anywhere."
"1358","Compared to the kindle fire, this is much easier to read on. I got it for a special price, so I really can't complain. I'm definitely happy with my purchase. However, I wish I had held out for the Paper White. I didn't think the light would make much of a difference but it would be impossible to read on the Kindle without a light on. Since I mostly read at night, I think the Paper White would have been a better fit."
"1359","I bought this for my daughter. She loves to read. She enjoys having the book in hand but enjoys the convenience Kindle brings when traveling. Buying books is easy and the print on the screen is good.  Very good product. Good price."
"1360","due to the size and the functionality, it's not that easy to use. I have a several year old kindle fire that I really liked, but the glare was frustrating. I wish I had gotten a larger size - the 6"" hardly fits much on a page - although it is certainly compact.Functionality is a little clunky and not as easy/intuitive to use as I'd expect."
"1361","Bought it for my son.  Was comparing with Fire HD 7, 8GB.....End result,Kindle is pure for readers to read.  It is simulating actual book by making sure reads under enough lights. With the technology it has, it's background and words look very much like actual book!Fire HD, having Kindle app, just like iPad Air/iPad mini or other tablets, it's a tablet.  Originally thought it will have option to turn itself to ""kindle"" when  selected, but obviously not.  I have decided to return Fire HD 7...*BTW, I got Kindle for $49 on Prime Day!  $79 for Fire HD 7, 8GB version!Thanks to Amazon!"
"1362","Exactly what I expected when I ordered it."
"1363","miss the light"
"1364","The lack of backlighting makes it limited"
"1365","I like this Kindle but I am thinking of upgrading to the backlight version and passing this one onto my son.  A little backstory, I like to read and I bought a phablet last year so I could use my cell to read during lunch.  My current job does not allow cellphones (or any camera/video device) of any type in the office so I purchased a Kindle.  While I like the concept of the Kindle I find that I miss the color screen of my phablet.  Also, I realized that I tend to read a lot a night and not having a backlight requires me to switch between my phone and the Kindle.In essence the Kindle does what I needed it to do but I think the backlight/color screen would be better for my use."
"1366","Does everything it is expected to. Small, lightweight. Battery lasts a long time.Read the description and you'll not go wrong.The 'special offers' are simply books shown on the sleep screen. Does not mess with the reading experience.only runs .mobi files cleanly (no epub) and pdfs cannot be easily zoomed, etc. Again, this is info easy to look up on the web, but worth considering.All in all, dirt cheap ereader. Good stuff."
"1367","My sister gifted me a Kindle about a year ago and it has changed my life quite drastically. I'm the kind of person who enjoys watching TV and movie adaptations of stories rather than reading books. But, after getting a Kindle, I've been reading about 5 novels every single month and the experience is just amazing. Recently I read ""the fault in our stars"" and watched the movie too and I could easily relate to why people keep bashing on adaptations. Anyway, coming back to the device. I really love how portable and lightweight it is. Unlike my smartphone, its battery lasts literally forever and I have to hardly ever charge it. The only thing I don't really like it is how it responds to every single kind of touch. It's sometimes really frustrating when you're in the middle of a story and the font changes."
"1368","I love it. It makes reading books so easy!"
"1369","Works great nice screen  very light kindle"
"1370","I cannot use my lighted cover with this kindle because it does not have the sensors on the back to connect to the light.... very disappointing and limits my night time reading options. Otherwise, it is easy to navigate and use."
"1371","Wish I'd gone for a better KIndle - I find the gray screen a bit hard to read by. Would be nicer if it were a paperwhite. But it works OK and if you can handle a light gray background rather than white, it will do the job of an e-reader"
"1372","I've loved it so much that I've ordered one more for my husband! It's awesome to have all your books in just one small and soft little ""book"". Perfect to carry in your pursy wherever you need to go. Don't get crazy choosing what book would like to read today.. Or what are going to do if you are finishing one book but you don't want to carry two books with you.. That's really perfect!"
"1373","This one's my backup Kindle--I leave the other one in odd places and then can't find it.  So taking advantage of the constant updating so I can pick either one up and keep reading from where I left off."
"1374","Wasn't exactly what i wanted but it will do"
"1375","Easy on the eyes.  Makes reading enjoyable."
"1376","i wish it had a back light,but like it alot"
"1377","it's a kindle..it's awesomeUpdate: Sept 2015Still love the kindle, but would highly recommend getting the Paperwhite model.  You will really want the backlight esp after you start using this more and more."
"1378","When I saw this advertised one day for $49.99 I thought I'd better get it, put it away for a gift.  When I received it, I decided to open it, remembering my old keyboard kindle was getting old, decided I need to keep it for myself.  What an amazIng deal!  I LOVE THESE THINGS."
"1379","I love This product !Help to read more, light weight, lot of book available (some problem with sentences layout).Perfect to read. As a book you need a light source to read.I'm waiting to see if battery duration is okay but I'm afraid of less than 3 week. (1 book more than 50% battery)It can be interesting to see the percent of battery on device."
"1380","I have had a kindle fire for a while and have been pleased with it as a tablet but I really wanted a reader specifically. They just have a better display for reading, especially outside where the glare of the tablet makes it very difficult to read. Then the debate was regular Kindle vs Kindle Paperwhite. I read a ton of reviews on both and watched video reviews and asked people I knew who had them. From what I gathered, the primary difference is that the Paperwhite has an internal light and the regular Kindle doesn't. Oh and the Paperwhite is $40 more. Amazon has an excellent return policy which I've used before and been happy with, so I decide to save the $40 and go with the regular Kindle, knowing that if the lack of a light really bugged me I could return it and get the paperwhite. Well I've had it two weeks now and I can understand how the light would be useful, but I am 100% pleased with my kindle. It reads perfectly, there are zero issues with the display (I've read reviews with the paperwhite having spots in some cases or uneven light), and it doesn't bother me in the slightest to read under a lamp. I give the Kindle 5 stars because it is exactly as marketed. What you see is what you get, no less, no more. It reads sooooooo much better than my Fire, and it's lightweight and super easy to use.If you're on the fence between a Paperwhite and the regular Kindle, my advice is this: if you regularly read in dim lighting (not just dark but dim) and don't have access to light to read by, think about the paperwhite. Otherwise, save the $40 and get the regular! It's awesome!"
"1381","Books cost more then willing to pay for and free books are part series not what I was looking for but other then that was really nice and worked great"
"1382","I like my earlier kindle better; it is simpler to use and does not bore me with advertisements, I need to contact Amazon to try to fix my old kindle."
"1383","My fave Xmas gift.  My first Apple product."
"1384","I bough this for my 11 year old. It worked quite well for a few months, then it started freezing up. I called customer service and was told that my warranty was about to expire, but that if we still had problems with the kindle a week or two after the warranty period Amazon would replace it. Well, exactly a week after the end of the warranty we had the same problem. I called customer service and explained to the lady what had happened. I also repeated my previous conversation with customer service. Well she was absolutely no help, all she did was try her best to sell me a new upgraded kindle. I am very disappointed in Amazon. What a let down, my 11 year old is quite frustrated and upset that she will not be getting any books for Christmas."
"1385","This item should come with some basic operating instructions or at least directions to where instructions may be found. I actually like my former Kindle better even though it is not a touch screen product."
"1386","kindle is fine reading is difficult no lights"
"1387","A great replacement for a heavy bag of books!"
"1388","This review is not about the Kindle, Version 2. It is about getting the dang thing to start up. After it is running it is fine.So, you ask, what is the problem. The problem is that it does not charge out of the box. With the original software.And, two. out of the three techs I spoke to. were not aware of the need to update the software to get it to accept a charge.Really. Unbelievable.A lot, I mean a lot, of time with tech support. Until, finally I met the dude who knew that the software update was essential.So, the questions  are: Why does Amazon ship the thing with software which does not accept a charge? And why does  Amazonnot inform the techs that a software update is essential to get the Second Generation Kindlle to accept a charge?That is what I would like to know.I rest my case."
"1389","like it very much , you can not image that ."
"1390","Won't display the books I bought for my son."
"1391","I bought this for my dad. He's 80 years old and his vision isn't as good as it used to be. No Light?!?! No Power Cord?!?!I saw the cord wasn't included but I could look past that. A little anyway.This one is clunky and big, too. I didn't like it from the moment I took it out of the box.Clunky and unreadable half the day. It's not even very good in low-light conditions. Ironically my lamp causes a glare on the screen. Major disappointment. Amazon loses this sale."
"1392","This Kindle is much nicer than the previous one I had, although I really like my last Kindle.  The new Kindle is more compact, easier to hold and the readability is better.  I did have trouble getting use to the touch screen and how the everything works, but the How to book that comes with the Kindle is very easy to follow.  Since I had my previous Kindle for over four years, habits develop.."
"1393","Love the size, and the touch to turn the page."
"1394","This is one of the best purchases I've ever made! I'm an avid reader, and I LOVE the feel of holding a hard copy book in my hand and turning the pages as I read. I am also in the habit of highlighting passages and making margin notes as I read nonfiction, which was a big reason for me not having been open to the idea of an electronic book. When I read the description of the Kindle 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen and saw that it has the highlight and note feature, I became more receptive to the idea of an electronic book. I chose the glare-free style after some debate because I thought about how difficult it is trying to read the screen of my Smart phone outside. I told myself I would just use the bedside lamp for night reading. Over the last couple of years, I have gotten into the habit of Googling topics on my phone in the dark before going to sleep. Usually, not always, I wake up the next morning with a terrible headache. The first night I read from my new 6"" Glare-Free Kindle, with the bedside lamp for light, I kept thinking to myself, ""This thing is so comfortable to hold....even lying down"". I really liked the fact that I could enlarge the font and not have to keep readjusting my glasses while lying on my side because I re-sized the font enough that I did not have to wear my glasses :-) ! The next morning when I woke up, after having read for hours on the Glare-Free Kindle, my head did not hurt at all! Now when I read outside, I don't have to find a shady spot nor do I have to hold the Kindle in weird positions trying to see what is on the screen like I have to do when I try to read my phone screen outside. Another GREAT thing I LOVE about having many books on the Kindle is that instead of dragging along a heavy tote bag full of books on trips, I will be able to stick my Kindle and my charger in my purse and will still be able to have a choice of what I'm in the mood to read. I'm so glad I finally decided to try something new after fighting the idea of changing to this new-to-me way of reading books for so long!"
"1395","Some reason thought I could read with no light"
"1396","Kindle rocks! It's so lightweight and the pages look like real book pages. I just connect a book light to the portfolio cover that I got for it and I'm all set for nightly reading in bed. The battery really does last for weeks."
"1397","Need a small back light for night time reading"
"1398","I do not understand your programs  you need to spell it out bett  I join  I get what  feebook where when ,you could make this a lot easier for us older people"
"1399","Still waiting for $20.00 promo after trade in"
"1400","I got it to my 13 years old son. He loves it."
"1401","believe it was defective, i just returned it."
"1402","Need more info included about how to use product"
"1403","I love it!  easy to use and comfortable to hold"
"1404","I can't believe I can't read it in the dark without an add-on light! Now I have to fiddle with an attachment. Brings back memories of the 80's reading a paperback in the car. We can put a rover on Mars, but no backlight???? Time to replace some engineers."
"1405","beacause the language come in chinese or japan"
"1406","Finally gave in and got a kindle, and I love it. It's better than a paper book in experience while reading, and touring so many books around is nice. I've barely scratched the surface, but I already wish I would have gotten one sooner. That said, there's a grounding, a nostalgia that only a premiere hardcover novel can bring (tactile, visual, olfactory), and a usefulness that only a paperback study book can bring (note taking, page marking, kinetic mnemonics)."
"1407","I have no problem with my eyes when I use this Kindle.  I love my Kindle Fire, but I cannot read it for hours at a time.  The Paperwhite is really just like reading a book, but easier to hold and carry around.  Best of all, no buttons on the face to accidently push."
"1408","I love my new Kindle! Small enough to hold in the hand and so easy to manipulate. Love being able to send text, PDFs, etc. to my Kindle address and be able to read them almost instantly on my reader! I strongly recommend buying a touchscreen stylus. It makes keeping the screen clear effortless--no smudgy fingerprints!"
"1409","First Kindle I have ever owned.  Just started loading books from Amazon.  Not yet comfortable with it.  I have always preferred a book rather than an electronic item but since there are so many books that only go to Kindle had to try.  .So far so good."
"1410","Met and passed all my expectations. This is my third Kindle and all still work just great. My original keyboard changed my world. My Fire is always ready to entertain me. The newest, the 6"" touchscreen is the lightest, most portable of all. Always have touchscreen with me which means never any wasted time. Traffic jam - no problem, waiting for an appointment or friend - quality time at a touch. My SONY stopped working after a couple of years, my NOOK was dropped one too many times too endure. My Kindles just go on. The book is dead, long live the ebook."
"1411","No power supply. No promised extras. Thumbs down."
"1412","Screen is too dark in a dimly lit room (at night)"
"1413","Do not like it at all. The menu was no help when I was trying to find my books.  I am very unhappy with this Kindle.  The directions are too hard to understand and follow."
"1414","Fine e-reader. Long battery life and can't beat the Black Friday price I paid for it. The ads are really obnoxious though and I am used to Apple products so it feels very clumsy and much less intuitive. But I really needed a light e-reader and this fits the bill."
"1415","I love this thing! I literally use it ALL the time as I am injured and spend a lot of my time alone in bed. You can group your books into collections you name, I.e., some of mine are ""fiction,"" ""non-fiction,"" ""Christmas,"" ""Game of Thrones Series,"" etc. (definitely handy for book series'!). Some people have griped about the screen being too sensitive. It is sensitive but I've never had a problem with it. I love my Kindle!!! :)"
"1416","I used to own a kindle with keyboard so like generations before and was pretty satisfied until one day screen stopped working and was like after couple of years I bought it, so, whatever. I then bought this one and it was fine like the one before but without all the buttons, now I'm giving 2 stars because I have two problems that really baffled me.1. I bought a book from gumroad and they only provide pdf at the moment for that book, fine, I use calibre to generate a kindle friendly format, sent it to my kindle account and started reading it there and boom! kindle will just restart itself. Fine, I'm using calibre, my bad, I then sent my pdf and started reading it and bam! again restarting. And not only that it would say kindle out of memory and restart.2. I bought a kindle book directly from amazon, reads fine and everything, and today it occurred to me that I wanted to do a search on the book, type, type, type, hit search, bang! again! restarting without saying anything.I'm really disappointed since both matters are something that my oldie kindle was able to handle, and now I spent bucks in something newer that's really dissatisfying. I don't think I'll ever buy any kindle or suggest any of my friends to do it."
"1417","I got this one to replace the second gen. kindle i had for years.  I wasn't sure about the touch screen and not having buttons, but after having it for a few weeks now i love it!!!! Page turn is super fast, home screen takes some getting used to after my old one but, battery life is better then my old one. Overall i am really happy i got this one and the price made it a no brainer."
"1418","It is lightweight and I could see and read outdoors  and it was very nice to be able to adjust the size of the print. so all together it met my expectations and is very nice. :-) a wonderful surprise!"
"1419","fantastic for what I use it for - reading.  print is clear and i especially like the dictionary feature. most of my reading is done while riding a recumbant bike but i will use this more and more as i exhaust my source of books."
"1420","the unite did not turn on, returned it for a refund"
"1421","What can I say. It's a Kindle, and when you have voracious readers, this hits the spot. My girls love them. No frills and whistles, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do. Would definitely purchase again or as a gift for another."
"1422","Perfect for reading books.  I love the glare free screen.  Its lightweight, easy to use and carry around.  It has a long battery life.  This is perfect for someone who just wants something to read on!"
"1423","I like that the e-reader saves paper but I wish the page numbers were chronological rather than random.  And I haven't figured out how to change the font - the last time I went to read it was huge and there is no text on the menu at the top.  I wish the name were different - reading should be enjoyable, not something morbid."
"1424","I purchased this Kindle when it went on sale for Prime Day. I am so happy with this purchase. It is durable, easy to read, and easy to connect to wifi and download books. I love that I don't have to go to a bookstore to browse and pay bookstore prices. My favorite thing about this Kindle is that I can download samples before buying a book to make sure it's something I'm even interested in."
"1425","Just getting use to it.  I like everything it has to offer especially the free books they have  because I love to read.  This really comes in handy.  And for a great price that I got on Thanksgiving.  No more buying hard cover books  to read."
"1426","At various times I encounter a fairly long lag between the time I tap the screen and the page turns.  Additionally, there are times when it takes several (more than 5 tries) to get the page to turn.  Frustrating...  This doesn't appear to be an anomaly.  My previous 6 inch model did the same.  Also, due to user error that I'm unaware of the screen often changes type size without any purposeful input on my end.  Don't know what I'm doing wrong here!  Owned three kindles now--liked the first generation best! All that said I still enjoy reading from the kindle better than from a book..."
"1427","For something to read with it's great.I was surprised it didn't have the ability to access the intr-net. The onboard Manuel said you could, but not true. But I didn't buy it for that purpose so was not a problem. But if you want to access the internet don't buy this model."
"1428","Amazon Kindle customer support is as poor as the device. We have had to buy 3 of these!!  First one crapped out and Amazon did what they should and replaced it. Second one failed (partial frozen screen) at 11 months.  When I enquired, it got interesting because A-Kindle support told me they couldn't help because I didn't have possession of the device. (It was with my child, overseas)  I got it about a week and a half later and then they told me they wouldn't honor a replacement because in the intervening 10 days the device crossed the one year return window.  Too bad for me.  Then they changed their mind on that explanation and said the 12 month warranty period does not apply to products given because the first product was defective - only to the first broken productThe Amazon Kindle algebra is apparently this simple: 1 defective product + 1 replacement defective product = only 12 month original warranty. The new math!They first offered me like $20 toward buying a new kindle. ha!  I already had to buy a refurb'ed one to send overseas to swap with my kid so they would have one and I could get the broken one back. So when I express my dismay about the support process, they ask me to contact them again and I go thru the whole episode and they bump up the coupon offer to $30. I still don't need a fourth and lost 30 minutes I'll never get back. Then they has the gall to send me a customer service email that says, ""I understand that how inconvenient it must have been to borrow a free book and sign up each time.""  Where did that come from???  We have always had wonderful customer service for all other Amazon products APART from the Kindle stuff. Never again!!"
"1429",". . . Believe it or not, this is the only other ""electronic device"" that I've purchased other than my laptop and cellphone - and an investment I'm glad I made! With a super-long battery life (I only charge my Kindle about once every 7-10 days) I know that this device will last me for years to come. It's very easy to navigate, and takes LESS than half an hour to charge. Five stars. ;-)"
"1430","This was a gift for a friend of mine.  She loves it!"
"1431","I like the Touchscreen, but I do wish it had a light"
"1432","I had the keyboard kindle and broke it by accidentally leaning on it.  Got this one to replace it.  Horrible product.  Way too sensitive and ads, ads, and freak'n ads.  What a joke."
"1433","I dislike that this doesn't have an auxiliary port."
"1434","Glare free but too dark to read without a light on."
"1435","A little disappointed as it has no light for night time reading-guess I missed seeing that in the specifications. It is fine for day light reading.Ordered the conversion plug and the cover separately as well as the instruction book, all in good order."
"1436","This is the best all around solution.  My wife loves this Kindle.  She can read all the time now, even in bed with the lights out and with the adjustable back light, she can turn it down so it doesn't bother me while sleeping.  I would recommend this model, it's affordable and does most everything you need."
"1437","Could not use for anything else but books.  Wanted to be able to play ""Everyword"" on it.  Didn't realize it was only for reading books.  As A result it was returned to the store."
"1438","I did Not Like it.It's too dark to read."
"1439","Convenient size but screen is too sensitive to touch"
"1440","Yes it's light weight! But I didn't like it overall."
"1441","Love it every day I use it more than the day before."
"1442","I know that I am way late to the Kindle game, but I am very impressed with this e-reader.  It's easy to use, lightweight, and has a great battery life.  I'm able to read 3 books without charging!  I also love that it is small enough to fit in my purse.  I bought it on sale for $49, and it was money well-spent."
"1443","This is my first kindle, and I love it!  The screen is small; however, the words are large enough to read.  The touch response is fast and I have had no issue turning the pages back and forth.  This device is not backlit, so you will need ambient light to read by.  This was not a huge deal for me because there is no ""screen-strain"" on your eyes.  Overall, I would buy this again."
"1444","The touchscreen is very good.  I am still getting used to it however. The ease of changing type size is great.  But I still haven't figured out how to access the game I had/have on my older version (which resurrected from the near dead upon arrival of the replacement).  The Times subscription is a little easier to use also.  On balance it is a better product."
"1445","OK, it's a Kindle so it's a great thing. However, it does not compare favorably to the older model. It is awkward to hold, which gets pretty significant when one is reading a book for more than a few minutes. The touch screen is either too sensitive or not responsive enough, depending on what you're trying to do. If you want to enter your code, it is unresponsive and takes a looong time to register each touch. If you're trying to move your fingers to a comfortable position, the screen registers the corner of your knuckle as a touch and starts to change the font or go to the home page, or something else that interferes with the actual reading. I broke my old model by mistake and am very, very sorry that I have to make do with this one now. Makes me wonder what reading a Nook is like. Battery life is good, as always."
"1446","Surprised there is no light. Should have not assumed."
"1447","Its wonderful I love it , I find myself reading more."
"1448","Super happy with this purchase best e-reader out there! This is well made the durability is impressive. The touch screen response is excellent with almost no delays, and of course the battery life last for almost an eternity! You can't go wrong with this e-reader, but don't expect to read comics on it for obvious reasons it's not designed for that but you still can load them on there with no issues. This is strictly for text novels. However Manga because of how it's drawn, works well on it, but if you're looking to read DC or Marvel you are better off getting a Kindle Fire to appreciate the artwork."
"1449","Perfect size & weight!  Glare-free reading made easy!"
"1450","Much smaller than my previous kindle and close to too small for my hands.  Screen functionality is only fair at best.  Difficult to get around and do what was almost automatic with my old Kindle.  This is not an improvement for me."
"1451","Bought for our granddaughter's birthday. She loves it/"
"1452","I found the directions a bit confusing. But, I am persistent. Also, I am VERY disappointed to find no backlight. I looked and looked for it and finally read that this model didn't have a backlight. Thank you."
"1453","I've been using this on my Kindle Fire for over a year and am very happy with it. It fits perfectly, there are no bubbles and no obstructions. One thing, I wouldn't call it ""glare free"" more ""glare reduced"". I'm not sure you can completely eliminate glare, but this does an adequate job."
"1454","Not what IExpected.  Wanted something different."
"1455","I had troubhle with the IPhone also. Sometimes my fingertips won't register. I press and press, but it just ignores me. Then again, if I reach to take a sip of my beverage, my sleeve will change the page. Maddening."
"1456","My 13 year old granddaughter purchased this to replace a Kindle Fire HD 1st Generation that she hardly ever used.  She was extremely limited as to when she could read from it.  She absolutely loves the improvements.  It's like a book, glare-free, and she can read anytime, anyplace.  It's lightweight and the features are updated and improved. This is the low-end model but has everything needed to make her very happy.  I'm going to be getting one for myself."
"1457","Good product and good price. It's perfect for reading."
"1458","It has a lot of lag time. It also freezes all the time"
"1459","This ended up being the perfect gift for my mom, who used to spend a lot of time searching through book stores for her favorite author. The only negative is I thought it came with a light but it doesn't, so you can't read in the dark. Also, as a side note, you're able to torrent books and convert them to EPUB or MOBI using calibre and load them right on to the kindle. I would convert them from PDF so that a cover is included and the feature that lets you define words.  Not that I would illegally download books or anything....hah....just saying it's possible."
"1460","This is a great Kindle. I love it. The only thing that keeps me from rating 5 stars is that there was a problem with my family library and I neeeded a lot of Amazon help to even get close to fixing it."
"1461","My first ereader! What a perfect gift. Everyone should get one. The ease of using it makes paper books feel like a chore now. If one hand gets tired, you can flip it upside down and use the other hand. It’s brilliant"
"1462","I liked my old kindle with the push button to turn page the swipe one is ok bu't I prefer the old model.  Sometimes when I swipe it thinks I want to highlight or something else .  I wish they hadn't changed it."
"1463","I bought it by mistake, my daughter wanted a Kindle Fire, so I was going to return it, but my husband convinced me to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I use to read a lot, but we also move a lot and packing books is a PITA, so I haven't bought new books in a while. Since I had the Kindle, I already read several book, 1 per week, even with my busy hectic schedule. The gray display is really easy on the eyes, the device is lightweight, fits in my purse and in my hand comfortably. I'm glad I didn't return it!"
"1464","It's light! It's user friendly. It's a great companion!"
"1465","Wish it had a light. Traded it in for a Samsung tablet."
"1466","This is a really great product it makes reading much easier whether you have too many books or if you have trouble with understanding words. Just highlight if your confused and the meaning pops up or it gives reference to other uses in the book you're currently reading. I would recommend a kindle to any book lover.​"
"1467","I adore my little Kindle. I didn't know that I would like it that much since we own two multi-use tablets, but it's very nice to tell my kid no, this is full of Mom's books and doesn't have anything on it for you. It's light weight and fits into a large coat pocket or the front pocket of my purse. I'm a huge fan."
"1468","I have wanted a Kindle since they first came out years ago. I was finally able to get one for myself this Christmas. Its my own personal tradition to get myself things as I shop for others so I don't get jealous. Anyway, this is one of the best gifts I have ever given myself. It is quick and easy to use and navigate. The battery I have only charged once in the month I have had it. I already have a nice little library of books to choose from. I hope to have this for years to come and I will definitely get another one when this one retires.Edit: Just a little side note, I don't make much but there are a lot of free books that are great on Amazon. There is also Kindle Unlimited which is like an Amazon library card and you can check out 10 books at a time for ten bucks a month. I also joined a site called Bookbub.com and they send daily emails with a list of books that are between 2.99 and Free! Ive added so many books to my Kindle library with that site. Its also not just for Amazon, there are books that are on Google and much more. So I can still read lots of books and not spend a ton of money."
"1469","The Kindle lives up to its promises. It was easy to setup, downloads books quickly, and is an enjoyable way to read. It's light to hold and turns pages quickly. Of course, without any light, you must use it in lit rooms or outdoors. This means the battery lasts a long time. I also have a smartphone and an iPad, so I can use one of them if I need a backlight. The Kindle software puts up a dialog box when you pick up your book, asking you if you want to jump to the most advanced position, no matter which platform you were last reading it on. Some (not all) books even have the option to read out loud, an audiobook. And they still keep track of your last stop point when you go back to the non-audio version of the book. I have always liked the Kindle reader software, now it's even better to have a Kindle, too. Especially, when I take it outdoors to read."
"1470","Really enjoyed the little time I spent with this before handing it over to my kid, the parental controls work great, and he really enjoys reading on it, (he really struggles with books but the kindle has made it a joy for him and he can adjust the text size to better fit his needs, fantastic tool for the little ones)"
"1471","Love it. Very small and extremely light weight. Fits right in the inner pocket of my vest and coat. Highly recommend it. You just need to get a light for night reading and found a slim cheap case on Ebay."
"1472","CAME DEFECTIVE WAITING FOR REPLACEMENT SUPPOORT WAS AWFUL"
"1473","I don't like it doesn't light up.. But I enjoy having it."
"1474","I am hooked.I would enjoy a little backlight tho..."
"1475","My wife finds it more complicated than she'd anticipated."
"1476","While trying to transition from paper books to digital, I found my backlit tablet hard to get adjusted to. So I thought that I would try the Kindle and I really like that the screen looks like a paper book page. I don't mind the advertising because it is not obnoxious - their is no blinking, flashing ad at the bottom of the page. The screen functions were simple and easy. The page turns were fast. I now have many books at my disposal while traveling without the weight and bulk of paper books. The Kindle was a great buy for me."
"1477","Good for just reading. Kind of wish it was back-lit. You have to read with good lighting, for sure. Great battery life. I rarely use my iPad now. Apparently I only really used my iPad to read. I use my phone for everything else. The Kindle is perfect because it's lighter than my iPad, but bigger than my cell phone."
"1478","It is NOT intuitive!  I still have to learn how to use it."
"1479","I have had this Kindle for 2 years.  I use it many hours per day and last night, it stopped working and I cannot revive it :(  I am elderly and lightly disabled, so reading is my best friend and I cannot read books as they are too heavy.  Kindle is light and works great during power outages.  Now, I will buy the same model and transfer the unread books.  Hopefully Amazon will transfer the books from the old one onto the new one.  Cannot go wrong with this e-reader."
"1480","Great.  Love it.  Easy to us and convenient for my cardio."
"1481","Not easy to navagate. I am reading a book, want to switch books and don't know how to get to main menu. When I was in the main menu not easy to find your books. Took time to figure things out.Easy to read. Swipe to change page is nice, but gentle or you could go a couple of pages. I feel once I get the hang of things it will be fine."
"1482","Had one of the first kindles ever and loved it but accidentally destroyed it...looked hard for a simple Kindle -my preference.  This is a bit smaller than I would like but I am enjoying the touch screen.  Had to work WAY too hard to find a cover that would fit it however."
"1483","Functional.  Love how lite it is.  The problem is the touch screen.  I had a Kindle Keyboard and loved it and used it to death.  The touch screen is very sensitive. Also the fact that different areas of the screen do different things.  This perhaps is just going to take some getting used to, but for now it is somewhat frustraiting.  The battery is amazing.  I have charged it twice.  Once when I first got it and then three weeks later."
"1484","Loved mine so much I bought one for my sister for Christmas."
"1485","Amazing I use it everyday and I love it fast smart portable"
"1486","Did not realize the text is smaller than I would have liked"
"1487","This is my second kindle ,  and I love it .. Great product."
"1488","Like it but where do I get a replacement for the power cord"
"1489","I love the display. It feels like I'm ready an actual book."
"1490","After a lot of oscillations between this one and the paperwhite and after side by side comparisons for several hours; i have decided this one.I could not see any resolution difference between them even with the smallest font.Since I can not tolerate any kind of illuminated screen, especially in dark, this one is perfect; thought you need some external light to read a real book.I bet god will send the next holy book directly to the kindle : )"
"1491","Pros:I like it a lot! I try to stay away from lighted devices as much as possible given how often I'm in front of screens and this is exactly what I wanted. Quick to work, clear, durable, and so thin and easy to carry around. It slides right in my purse! I'm so glad kindle kept carrying the original.Cons:The battery dies pretty quickly- I turn it off but it dies much more quickly than the original I had before.I'm also a bit disappointed that it has a small black mark on the screen that doesn't seem to go away but I've gotten used to it and for the price it can be ignored."
"1492","It doesn't work correctly.  I can't advance or turn the page."
"1493","First one I received did not work correctly - locked up and wouldn't fully charge. Exchanged for a new on and it works great. Working with the ""Kindle Specialist"" was a pain, but eventually got the job done."
"1494","I am very happy with my new Kindle.  Being new to Kindle, this model met all my expectations and is a very easy reader in both daylight and at night.  It does not have a backlight which I wondered how I would like that, however, I do not miss it.  It is light weight and fits nicely in my purse to keep with me at all times.  My only issue is the advertising that Amazon puts on for the screensaver that I have to look at all the time unless I completely power down the screen.  I don't like to be sold to constantly on a device, that I bought, and wish I could change the screensaver!!!  Therefore I give it a 4 star versus 5."
"1495","screen is great in bright light, nearly useless in dim light."
"1496","It was wonderful gift from my son and family for Mother' Day."
"1497","archived items from old kindle not transferred to new kindle."
"1498","Makes reading easy and addictive! Actual books are not for me"
"1499","Everything I was hoping for.  Arrived in 2 days. How awesome."
"1500","Great product, set up support from Amazon was 5-star as well."
"1501","I have never had a kindle, always read from an android or iPad, so the no glare is great.  Just wish I could brighten the background just a bit. It is also hard to see the books I haven't as yet read."
"1502","I bought my first kindle about 4 years ago and it ended up freezing up on me. I returned it to Amazon and got a $20 credit towards a new one which was awesome. I'm glad I upgraded mine anyway, this model is way more intuitive to use and the touch screen feature is an upgrade from what I had."
"1503","I purchased this Kindle with a Christmas gift-card.  This was never dropped, dunked or stepped on.  It completely quit working in less than 6 months.  I did a hard reset, which brought it back to life for a week.  Then it quit again and will not restart.  I've had a kobo for 3 years.  It is still working hard.  I regret every kindle book I bought and now can only access on my tablet."
"1504","I am very happy with my new Kindle, that replaced my first generation one. Spending a couple of weeks without my Kindle was a nightmare! I am looking forward to having it as my constant companion wherever I go. My Kindle is an essential aspect of my work as a travel writer - it is my big-small reference book for all my writing resources.(Visit richardzahra.weebly.com to read some of my travel articles)I would also add that Amazon's delivery service is incredibly efficient. My Kindle was delivered in 3 days. Well done Amazon!"
"1505","This is a gift and I can not tell you how happy she is with it"
"1506","This is my 3rd Kindle and I must say I prefer the first one which had a keyboard.  I love the backlit page however and can read all night with no lamp on!  I long for my page turning buttons since dexterity becomes a problem with age and when I hit to turn a page  it may be to hard or in the wrong place and all kinds of surprises occur!  I read so much (up to 3 books a day) that I get frustrated with this version of Kindle.  I am certain that dexterity only declines so who knows what the future Kindles will bring for us older folks but hope the innovators keep us in mind!"
"1507","Very good for the price.I bought it with advertising. I thought it would bother me, but the truth is that the ads are pretty, also only show up when it's on standby. I loved that does not reflect sunlight, and is very light.So far, I recommend it. Economic, good quality, very easy to carry and the screen is very sensitive."
"1508","I had to return this product after only 3 weeks.  It would not find Wi-Fi so I could not add or purchase ebooks."
"1509","My Kindle Keyboard lasted 5 years and when it died I quickly purchased the simple 6"" glare-free model. Right away I was disappointed that it doesn't have the side flippers for turning pages. I find that more often than not when I touch the screen on the right side to move to the next page it flips forward a few pages, not just one.When I lay on my (right) side and read in bed while holding this Kindle with my left hand - I can't turn the page! May not seem like a big deal, but it is to me. I must investigate the other available Kindlesto see if there is one more suited to my needs."
"1510","I like my Kindle. This is the first one and I received it for Christmas last year. I love reading and the fact I can get free books or even low cost books are Awesome. With me on a fixed income this is Great. I may in the future get a Kindle with a light built into it but out from that I have no complaints."
"1511","good device.  makes reading more enjoyable than regular tablet."
"1512","Can't figure how to lighten background to read without light on"
"1513","it is smaller than the original Kindle, but overall it is great"
"1514","RETURNED IT.....PREVIOUS KINDLE WAS PAPERWHITE WHICH I PREFER."
"1515","Good for the prize perfect was sitting on the beach in reading"
"1516","I like the Kindle a lot, but have had some difficulty figuring out how to get everything set up via the user guide.  Some of it I'm still sorting out, but I'm getting there.  The unit itself is lightweight, easy to read and use.  I did notice that the colder my fingers were, the more trouble I had getting the touchscreen to work."
"1517","I took advantage of a Prime Day deal to buy this for my partner, who is an avid reader but a reluctant adopter of new technology. I have a first-generation Kindle Fire that I like very much, and hoped my friend would benefit from the convenience and portability of an e-reader. There was no trouble at all setting it up, and the matte screen looks great -- he doesn't mind the lack of a light, especially if it means longer battery life (it does). He loves the small size, the ease of buying books and the sleekness and user-friendliness of the Kindle. The ads (book suggestions) are not a problem at all; they're very subtle and sometimes interesting."
"1518","This was surprisingly user friendly to start up, and set up, for my preferences.  The glare free feature is by far and away the best feature.  I am using this strictly for reading purposes and for that it is wonderful.  Light weight, small enough to fit in my small purse, and easy to use."
"1519","10x better then the old e book readers. Love the touch screen aspect. This lesser model is nice and simple. No bells or whistles. Cool dictionary aspect. It even let's you see areas of the book people highlighted most. Overall, exactly what I needed... I can't bring a book to work but this is perfect"
"1520","Very happy with my new kindle (version 7 I believe).  I never had one before.  I'd read on my phone or tablet, but this is so much more comfortable to hold and easier on the eyes.  I bought a reading light with it and I couldn't be happier."
"1521","I have Kindle Fire but the backlighting is hard on my eyes. So I got Kindle Touch. I like it much better. I get a much more comfortable on my eyes experience when I am reading. I will still use my Fire for other things, but for reading, Kindle Touch."
"1522","Easy to activate. I love this Kindle because I can easily slip it in my purse or coat pocket so I always have a book handy to read. I do miss the buttons to turn pages available on the first Kindle I owned."
"1523","Hard to read. Screen not bright enough for a older person to use."
"1524","I wasn't sure how much I would use it but it's great. I love it."
"1525","This is a horrible Kindle. I purchased this when I lost my backlit one. About 3 months later, they've come out with another backlit Kindle. Clearly a case of planned obsolescence. Very disappointed in this Amazon product and in Amazon."
"1526","My wife doesn't like it at all, she would rather have a tablet."
"1527","Very easy to use and to transfer everything from my old Kindle."
"1528","This is exacly what I wanted!I love reading and this device provides me with an easy way to carry books and magazines (the ones with few pictures)  every where. The battery goes weeks with out recharging,  It is light weight and fits in my purse. This is my second Kindle. My first is a 1st generation Fire, which is great, since you can do a lot more with it. However, my second one goes everywhere."
"1529","I absolutely adore my kindle! i love that it is small enough to take just about anywhere you can take a phone, and even though it doesnt have its own light, i find thats easy to work around (dollar store booklight saved my life while in the hospital one night)I also have a pretty savere astigmatism, so my eyes strain easily when looking at computer screens, but the kindle doesnt give me that issue!Overall I am a happy little book worm who has already downloaded too many books to her kindle and is considering quitting her job to catch up wtih her reading... :)"
"1530","I have only had my Kindle for a short amount of time, but I absolutely love it.  I use to be completely against eReaders when they first came out and thought that actual books were just so much better.  However, after taking a long vacation recently I understood how nice it would be carry around hundreds of book on a device that takes up hardly no space.  I also really enjoy the no glare screen that makes me feel like I reading from an actual book.  I would personally recommend this to anyone who loves to read books.  Another plus is the ability to rent books from a library (no late fees)!"
"1531","screen much to  small  be useful. I'll br returning this product."
"1532","I hate to say it but I bought a nook for about the same price and the kindle is absolutely amazing. I have amazon prime and amazon unlimited both go well with this product. The functionality of this device for the price is better than the standard nook. But the nook is still good."
"1533","I had and older Kindle that was actually a hand me down. It wasn't even touch screen! I loved it anyway... Well, one fateful day, I sat on it and cracked the screen. It sucked. This one is so new and shiny. Literally. Very easy to read display, no straining, no squinting. Menues are straightforward, just a quick swipe and click to adjust most settings. I'll admit I was slow to get a digital reader and this isn't a real fancy one (you can get on the regular internet,  it has a browser) but for someone that thinks sitting at home and reading is like a dream vacation, Kindle is the s***!"
"1534","i have very limited needs for this product and it meets all of them"
"1535","Bought it for my daughter. We both love it. I like the touch screen"
"1536","I wish I can click the frame to go to the next page like Nook does."
"1537","This is my first Kindle and it did not come with any instructions!"
"1538","Loved it, works a little slow at first but I can deal with that..."
"1539","Makes reading very easy to see like a paperback bookLove it!"
"1540","I have been against readers, due to glare and size. As an avid reader, there is just 'something' about an actual book in your hands. This has been a great substitute! There is no glare. Its lightweight. It actually reads like a book. Its suprising how much the font looks and reads like a book. I like that I can carry many books on my kindle, I ride the train as commute and now I don't have the weight!! Thanks Amazon, just another reason I am a returning customer!!"
"1541","amazing"
"1542","Good in a pinch when we are both readng but it really needs a light."
"1543","Seems like u need WiFi for everything.do like how light it is"
"1544","Priced at $30 it's ok, but you'll need a reading light or sunlight."
"1545","Great! User friendly, only downfall is I bought it for $79 after waiting 2weeks for the price to drop, the day after I purchased it(needed by Xmas) the price went down to $59 😒 typical. Bought as a gift for my teen daughter who has recently discovered a love for reading. I'm sure she will get plenty of use out of this."
"1546","I love my Kindle(s).  My wife has 1 and I purchased this one for myself.  Definitely great for the beach as there is absolutely NO GLARE.  Highly recommend picking one of these up, if for no other reason than travel-reading."
"1547","GREAT.......READ 4 OR 5 HOURS A DAY.......JUST A GREAT LITTLE THING ."
"1548","I really would like the option to change the color of the background."
"1549","Just need to find a cover that isn't to costly  I love my new Kindle."
"1550","The nonglare screen is awesome. Reading at the pool is no problem. I was skeptical but it is beyond my expectations.  In addition,  I recently had a detached retina and I can actually see and read more clearly on my kindle than on the printed page.  So pleased!"
"1551","I like the ease of use of this tablet as well as the screen.  It is handy to have a touch screen.  Previously I owned one of the very first kindles that came out.  I liked it, however, the buttons that turned the page had been a problem for me, flipping too soon, etc.  That is why I like the touch screen.  The icons are well arranged.  Well done!"
"1552","Things I liked about Kindle - 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi:1) Light and Easy to carry around. Weighing only 191 gms and with a size of just 6.7” x 4.7” x 0.40” (169 x 119 x 10.2 mm) this device is sleek, lightweight and super easy to carry around.

However, we can read books at night if proper lighting is there around us.2) Power Adaptors not provided with the device: Only a USB cable is provided which can be connected to a computer to charge the device but to get a power adaptor we have to buy it separately.Conclusion:All in all, despite not having a built-in light, the Kindle - 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi variant of the Kindle device is a value for money product.

"1553","Can't get the screen to light up.  Only readable in bright light areas."
"1554","It came in in French and was hard to find how to convert it to English"
"1555","didnt think i would need it but the light would have been nice i think"
"1556","It definitely lives up to the advertising.  I am very pleased with it!"
"1557","Absolutely Love my Kindle!  The size is perfect. Clear easy to read print. Quickly downloads your books upon purchasing, etc. While it would be nice if this one had a back-light, for the rare low-light reading occasion...The fact that it does not have a back-light is no big deal, since most of my reading is done outside and at all other times, in a well lit room.  Great Price!!! So glad I made this purchase!!!! Would totally buy it again."

"1563","Now I have to learn how to get my acct back from Amazon .. I am stumped"
"1564","This thing has a display that's a nasty grey-green. It looks like something that's dying a slow death. Pictures are a foggy mess.I sent it back immediately. Avoid this piece of garbage."
"1565","I loved mine, but I returned it. Cause I'm going to get a Kindle with built in Wifi for anywhere book pick up. I also couldn't really afford it at the time. So I returned it. But it is a good device. I just wish that the Kindle would make it good with a stylus and turn it into a journal notebook too."
"1566","This is a downgrade from the previous version.What you gain with the touchscreen is more than offset by the downgrade to a cheap plastic casing. This Kindle feels something you would buy because you can't afford a Kindle. And this lack of quality is not something you get used to. I have been using this Kindle for months and it still feels cheap to me.The only thing preventing me from switching to the Paperwhite, which my wife uses and which is made of noticeably better materials, is that the Paperwhite does not allow you to completely turn off the screen lighting while you are reading. If device lighting is not an issue for you, buy the Paperwhite. If you are like me and do not want to stare into a lighted device at the end of the day, wait a few months and hope that the next generation of the basic Kindle is built to higher standards, with better materials."
"1567","I recived this for my birthday, since I LOVE to read. I literally cannot tell you how awesome it is. Every single thing about it is a complete plus, but there is two downfalls. It is sometimes a bit slow and it also leaves a faded mark of the text if you go to a new page. Those minuses are NOT a big deal. If you're not sure to buy it or not, man up and do. This device is great, You'll love it!*UPDATE* Oops. Go ahead and laugh at me. I reviewed the wrong item. I was reviewing the kindle paperwhite 2nd gen. Sorry, guys."

"1573","Although the touch screen is a bit too sensitive (I've accidentally changed the page by breathing on it, like seriously what) I love this kindle. It's got better storage than my old one did and it's easy to find all my books. I wish that the special offers on the lock screen would sometimes actually be something halfway aesthetically pleasing, but I didn't buy it to look at the ads."
"1574","I had been borrowing my wife's Kindle because I was having to use my iPad for other things and needed it to keep its charge up. This Kindle has taken a little getting used to but it still works a lot like my wife's older model."
"1575","to hard to find the book I am looking for.  How can I list titles only.  Difficult to find instructions.  The original kindle was much more usableWhat I need is complete instructions on line, so I can make copies."
"1576","I'd rather have a Kindle keyboard but this is the best that's available."
"1577","I am really looking forward to the big screen size, for example A4 size."
"1578","Nice, though my aging eyes would appreciate a whiter background. But I'm glad it's not backlit. Size is fine. The touchscreen is just a little bit unpredictable, sometimes over-responding, sometimes not responding. I wonder if this has anything to do with cold fingers, as this happens to me with other electronics, too. Overall, I'm pleased with this."
"1579","This is fabulous. I have been reading my kindle books on my iPad. After looking at the computer all day at work though I didn't want to look at a computer screen anymore. I finally decided to try this and it really feels like reading a regular paper book. So much better than reading on my iPad!"
"1580","The product itself is lovely and exactly what I wanted for my daughter.  HOWEVER I'm still REALLY annoyed.Only after I purchased this device did I find out that the FreeTime subscription (which ensures your child won't be able to accidentally purchase content) can't transfer public library materials already checked out to your device.  So if your child checks out digital materials from your local public library and wants to read them on your Kindle they can't do it safely in FreeTime.  They have to read it from the home screen where they can access EVERYTHING.  I suppose this is more a failing of the FreeTime software than the device but if that is the case, why is that a KindleFire will allow this functionality?  Why can't I have this function on my device??90% of the reason I bought this Kindle as part of the Kindle for Kids bundle is so that my daughter could easily access free library content.  I'm annoyed that in order to allow her to do that it appears I have to give her access to my Amazon account.  I'm hoping to find another way than FreeTime (or getting her her own Amazon account) to block my daughter from purchasing content.  But I haven't found it yet and that's another problem I'm having with Kindle - the difficulty of finding answers to specific questions."
"1581","This kindle is just the right size for me. I also dont think that the screen is sensitive at all.I find that I need to use a stylis to go to the next page. I hope this helps in making someone's decision to buy this new kindle easier."
"1582","This was a surprise gift from a friend. What a great surprise! And I was reading a book as soon as I found one on amazon. Itwas quick to do and the kindle is very easy to read. Even with my 60 something eyes. I do not even have a smart phone so thekindle was unexplored technology for me. The kindle is a fun way to read books."
"1583","I bought this to replace my daughter's old Kindle. She had one of the first generation Kindles (you know the one with a keyboard). She loves the compact size of this. It is easy to travel with. It stays charged for quite a while. Her only issue is sometimes the page ""sticks"", but it doesn't happen often.Its really nice for her to be able to carry a large quantity of books to read without the weight."
"1584","I love this device.  It has a dictionary that I can touch a word that I do not know the meaning of and it will give the meaning to me in a few seconds.  I like the lock page where I stop reading.  I am still learning about the device, but I love it."
"1585","I already own a Kindle Fire, which  I adore. In some ways, however, this device has some advantages over my Fire. Its text is quite easy to read in nearly all all lighting situations. It keeps a charge for a VERY long time and reading is more pleasurable to the eye on the Kindle 6"". I also seem to be able to read faster on this device.  I find it complements my Kindle Fire, for magazines and books witch color illustrations, I rely upon  my  Fire, for text only works, like novels or short story compilations, the Kindle 6"" is the device I prefer. It  was, for me, a quality product and a smart purchase."
"1586","I have had a kindle fire for a while, and always found it near impossible to use it in sunlight. I love to read so suggested my husband bought me an e-reader.  I received my reader a few weeks ago and took it on holiday to New Orleans.  It's brilliant! I have carried it in my handbag all over the southern states, it's so light it adds next to no weight to what I was carrying. I used it on the plane, in the car, by the pool. It went everywhere with me.  It is so light you can use it with one hand, you can adjust the font size, to suit your needs. It holds thousands of books which you can organise into categories/ authors, the page turn is quick and easy with a light tap. The battery lasts for many days / weeks on a single charge. All I can really say is it is what I have been looking for,  for a long time.  It's 'The bee's knee' s'"
"1587","Got this on prime day for $39.00.  Nice and compact.  Highly recommend!!"
"1588","Touch screen and software is much better than old version, also resolution and refresh speed is superb. Unfortunately the material of the reader is quite a downgrade it is all made of plastic and feels cheap in my hands, also the device is too thick for an e-reader. After using paperwhite and voyage, I miss background light a lot. It's really cheap, but I would not mind several extra bucks for better material and thinner design."
"1589","Got this on a promo for $29 and we love it.  My wife said in hindsight that we should have gotten more than 1.  I wish it had the ability to read the book and had a light option, but with this being the bottom-end model, it is understandable that some of the features had to be cut to save cost.  Those items being missing weren't deal breakers for us, especially at the $29 price we paid.  If we were paying full price, however, I'd probably rather drop a few more dollars for the more feature-rich paperwhite models.I hope to one day see a full-color e-ink display in one of these.  LCD displays for book-reading gets the job done, but it isn't ideal for some of the same reasons Amazon teases the iPad for in their commercials.  It's a bit silly considering Amazon has a direct competitor with iPad with the Kindle Fire product line."
"1590","I am very satisfied with my Kindle.  I can read easily in bright sunlight.  It is easy to use and performs just as advertised.  I do miss seeing my Library in color as it is on my I-pad but that in no way detracts from my satisfaction.  I will recommend this product without reservarion."
"1591","Am happy to have the Kindle to use just as a reader. I love my Kindle Fire but the screen for the HD is to hard to use outside. Since I spend a lot of time at the beach the new Kindle is just perfect with it's non glare screen and very light weight. Couldn't beat the price on it either."
"1592","It was to dark and I didn't like that it didn't light up for night reading"
"1593","This was a great item for the money!! My first kindle and I am very happy."
"1594","was not what I really wanted send it back in exchange for the kindle fire."
"1595","I can read books. I'm only putting something here because I can't skip it."
"1596","LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. my kindle. This is the third one I've bought. I'm a bit rough on them (military wife living international with homeschooled kids) so my stuff gets wear & tear! My kindle is my lifeline.My only regret is not getting the one with the built in light. It makes a big difference in dark rooms & travel."
"1597","Excellent Kindle for an 11 year old!  However her previous Kindle had the light built into the cover....Make a basic Kindle for a child with a built in light that is reasonably priced...like the Fire but less expensive and lighter"
"1598","This is the first Kindle I have owned, Paperwhite.  I do nothing but read.  But setting outside with a Nook or tablet was really a downer.  And because I do read all the time, recharging the battery after a couple of hours was a chore.  I can read all day on the Paperwhite and still have plenty of battery time left.  Thank you Kindle!"
"1599","I thought this kindle did text to speech but it doesn't . That was the mean reason I was getting it. I did keep it because it was small and it fit in my hand bag . Works great and the middle size between my iPhone and iPad."
"1600","Wish I can type Chinese and listen to pronounciation as I can on kindle app."
"1601","I hate the touch screen and it is heavy. I really wish I had not bought it."
"1602","For a very basic ereader priced at $54.00, it's just about what I expected."
"1603","I love Kindle - can't live without it.  So when my original Kindle that was given to me in 2008 finally wouldn't work I was frantic.  As soon as the new one arrived my old one mysteriously started functioning again.  So now I have them both working and can really compare the functions.  I still prefer the old one with the keyboard at the bottom.  It's easier for me to access the keyboard WHEN I WANT TO and not by accident as always happens with the new touchscreen Kindle.  I like the smaller overall size of the new one but not enough to give up the keyboard of the original.  I'm constantly touching the screen by accident and then have to figure out how to get rid of it.  I know I'll get used to it but it's annoying to have to do so.  The lighter weight of the newer one is nice considering that the weight of books is the reason I tried the Kindle to begin with.  I will eventually get used to the newer version.  Don't see much difference in the readability of them."
"1604","I bought this for my husband who is a staunch paperback fan and he likes it. So, a conversion may have just occurred. Plus, we can read the same books together. I like that part! This will be my 3rd kindle purchase. I bet you can guess I love my kindle :)"
"1605","This is my first Kindle, therefore I can not compare with the previous version. Anyway, this kindle is perfect for me: small size and easy to handle. I really like it. It is true that sometimes tapping on the screen doesn't work at first, but it is just a matter of practice. Maybe the only thing that I do not like so much is adverstisment of products different than the ones related to Kindle. For new kindle users I really recommend it. :)"
"1606","Already set up for me right out of the box...I wasn't expecting that.  It is easy to use and fast.  There are not hiccups when changing pages, fonts or applications.  Best of all, I can read in bright outdoor light wearing sunglasses."
"1607","Every word is not available on this product and I am disappointed with that."
"1608","Cheap plastic that wouldn't stick very well and bubbles no matter what I do."
"1609","No instructions had to try out. Very difficult.  Don't anticipate is a GEEK!"
"1610","It did not live up to the level of my other Kindle's. I thought that it would read to you but it doesn't. Also the directions weren't what I expected.The cover did not help matters as the quality was not as good as I expected again.-+"
"1611","Perfect e-reader for my 8 and 10 year old. Small and very light-weight. Long lasting battery. Easy to download e-books from our public library. Note this does not light up for night-time reading and is just an e-reader, not a tablet."
"1612","Great product.  I bought this as an extra for traveling and buy the pool.  I love my Kindle Fire, but this has a longer battery life.  I really like the feature of the Kindles that allows you to read on multiple devices and have them go to your current page when switching."
"1613","Great and simple book tablet! Yes, there is no light so you can't read in the dark, but it looks just like a book and doesn't hurt my eyes! Also it's very easy to get onto wi-if and order books through Amazon. Very light weight and small enough to throw into my purse. So happy I got this!"
"1614","Awkward to hold. And any touch, even a bedsheet, can cause a page turn or two."
"1615","I thought the background would adjust according to environmental light sources"
"1616","Before you purchase this please be advised that this Kindle does not have a light.This is a VERY basic eReader. You can shop and download books from the Kindle Store.. you can also use Good Reads through this Kindle. It is not able to surf the internet or play video games. It is meant for someone who just wants to be able to read books outside on an ereader and not have a glare.It is perfect for what it does."
"1617","This did exactly what I wanted it to do:  be visible and read-able in bright sunshine on a cruise ship and beach.  I downloaded some of my books into it and it worked great. I wanted the version with the built-in light for night-time reading, but Best Buy was out of them when I went to get it.  Nevertheless, daytime reading in bright sunlight was the reason I bought it, and it was perfect for that."
"1618","Perfect grab n' go or snuggle up for the afternoon buddy. Love being able to hold it while in bed without the threat of a heavy book falling on my face or tiring my wrist/arm. It's the best thing to be able to whip out my novel instead of my iphone when stuck in a long line or on the train."
"1619","Had a couple older Kindle models, so my review is based on my personal experience and unfulfilled expectations from supposed to be the leader of e-Reader pack.Pro: Screen contrast got better. Touch screen is (no pun intended) a nice touch.Con: The Kindle case is chunky, uncomfortable and awkward to hold. You can't turn a page with one hand as with an older Kindle by pressing on the side buttons. The case made from a composite material which has worst texture feels compare with an older model. May be Kindle ergonomic department lost touch (again, no pun intended) to what a nice book feels like to hold, but this is just my take on it.Unknown: Haven't check on battery life, but don't expect much, because the touch e-ink screen is an active device compare to a regular e-ink screen.Wish list: lighter weight, a little larger screen and softened with memory case would be attractive for my next purchase.Disclaimer: I waited and bought it for $50 from Amazon. So all my grumble were overweighted by $30 difference to a regular price.For this price it is the best e-Reader on the US market!"
"1620","I am addicted to this Kindle.  It's small, light-weight, and portable.  There is no glare, so you can read forever!  I love the vocabulary builder which stores the words I look up.  I am connected to Goodreads on the Kindle, so my friends and I can suggest books to read.  It was so easy to set up.  My one problem was finding a case for it.  The one suggested that I order was not the right fit.  Luckily my mom had one that fit."
"1621","I really enjoy reading on this thing.  Ads are a non-issue.  I keep it in airplane mode and the battery lasts for weeks without a charge.  Only negative is the touch screen page turning, which never seems to turn back a page correctly when you want to.Otherwise, I'm not missing a real book much at all."
"1622","Love my Kindle!! First one I've owned and am really enjoying it. I love how when you turn it off when you're finished reading, it takes you right back to the page you were on the next time you power it on. Great device. Highly recommend it!!"
"1623","I decided to start reading more and this was the easiest solution. The price was right and it is so easy to use. My birthday is coming up  and asked all gifters to get me giftcards for Amazon so I can get busy reading. Plus I've gone to the free selections and have some in mind there as well.YAY AMAZON!!!"
"1624","It was great! I saved so much money! There are free books on here too! Love it!"
"1625","I bought it because the old kindle I had did not have a working  "" home"" option any more .It is smaller than I thought . It is harder to use than I had hoped . All the ads that pop up when you power it up are very annoying .  I liked the looks of the screen in my original kindle much better .  It was very easy to sync up with my old kindle . I bought it because the old kindle I had did not have a working  "" home"" option any more .I do not recommend this product to anyone . There must be a better choice in the kindle product line out there ."
"1626","Was disappointed in this for MY purposes. Bought it as gift for Elderly Mother. Don't could be adjusted, but screen could NOT be made brighter so she couldn't read with it. Customer service rep with Amazon was FABULOUS:  She did the research, recommended the Paperwhite, handled the return and replacement and it's been PERFECT!!"
"1627","After reading some of the bad reviews I was nervous about purchasing this new Kindle. I recently broke my prior Kindle (recliner crunched it) and was lost without it. I purchased this new Kindle and I could not be more happy with it. I think that if you are already accustomed to electronics with touch screens this will be no problem. One negative thing I found about this Kindle is that the new one is made of plastic, where the other one was metal. I do believe that the older kindle felt better in my hand, but I got used to this new one with no problems. It would not stop me from buying it."
"1628","I purchased 2 of these for my younger children and I am so happy with my purchases. I have yet to be unhappy with anything I have ever purchased from Amazon. These reader's are one of those purchases you make and think, "" why didn't I do y that sooner!"" Hehe 😄"
"1629","I am so happy with my new kindle. What i like most about the kindle is that i can read for an extended amount of time and it is so light that my my arm does not hurt unlike when i read with my nook or even a book. I also like that you can skim through the pages and not lose your place. These are just some of the things i love about the kindle but there are many more. I would recommend this kindle as the #1 e-reader."
"1630","I love the kindle. Very happy with my purchase. I will be using it to read often."
"1631","I love my new Kindle.  I love the size and the touch screen.  It is my third Kindle.  My first was  Christmas gift a few years ago.  I then bought a Kindle Fire.  I am a Prime member and love the fact that I can do email, watch movies, surf the internet or read using my Fire.  I use my new Kindle to do most of my reading.  I can use one hand to hold it and turn the pages with the touch screen.  I love my Kindles and the world of entertainment they bring me.  I have bought my wife two Kindle.  One for mainly reading and a Kindle Fire for movies, email, etc.  I also bought my son a Kindle Fire for Christmas 2013.  We are all Kindle lovers and appreciate the many great offers that Amazon makes available for Kindle owners."
"1632","I picked up reading after a while, but now, this little thing is inseparable from me.  It is magnificent when traveling, stealing little moments of waiting for the next mode of transport or being alone in a new place.  This little companion is like a best friend with your own magical library.Only grouse: the touchscreen is too sensitive... an insect can turn turn the page!"
"1633","So many adds. I didn't realize if I'm not reading all you see is advertisements."
"1634","Love it!  I bought this a s a replacement for my keyboard Kindle and it's been wonderful.  I do miss the page turn buttons on the side of the case, as sometimes I turn pages accidentally, but I'm getting used to it."
"1635","Just replaced a 2010 2nd generation Kindle that died when I dropped it. This is much lighter, text is more clear, and I really don't miss the 3G since it has wi-fi. And there's no chance of me getting distracted form reading like I would on my phone or iPad. If you want a basic reader and don't care about a backlight (which I didn't want anyway), then this works great."
"1636","This version is still clearer (greater ppi) and lighter than the last one I got.  I was too cheap to go for the 300ppi version though.  Graphics remain a challenge.  The concept of ""Collections"" is nice but difficult to use.  I can only move content between Collections using the Kindle instead of providing other means such as the Web where a mouse and keyboard would be handy.  Or better yet, the Kindle UI could be improved.  Seriously thinking of not using the Collections idea until it's easier to manage."
"1637","I got the cheapest version of the Kindle 6"" which it is not advertising free. Nevertheless the reduced price  I paid for the device, it is worth it.  The advertising is barely noticed. It comes only on the screen saver, and even though the instructions state that there might be advertising at the bottom of the device while reading, I really didn't notice it since I started reading my favorites books several weeks ago.English is not my tongue language (as you can notice while reading my review), so the vocabulary builder is totally useful. I do not give to the device the fifth star because it does't come with a speaker to take advantage of the Text-to-Speech feature."
"1638","can't get it to work right . I have only been able to download the one book Maude."
"1639","It's great and works great. But it's just way to touchy. I barely sweep my hand by it and it turns the page, or it changes the font. Can't leave it in my purse because something will touch it. If it's trying to mimic a real book it has failed horribly."
"1640","Excellent for curling up on a bed with ... i usually fall asleep reading books ..."
"1641","Very disappointed. The screen is much too dark. Terrible product. Waste of money."
"1642","Great little reader!  I got it for my husband so he could read at the beach and out in the sun.  His Kindle Fire (which he loves) did not allow that. It is light, responsive and just a fun little device.  It does come with advertising on the ""start page"", which I wish I could get rid of.  That's my only complaint."
"1643","I ducking love it! I have always been a reader but the high cost of books left me with only a free metro in my hand and a new book maybe twice a month. Now with this kindle, and the kindle unlimited subscription service, I have a multitude of assorted things I can read for only $9.99 a month! I kind of feel like that guy in that one twilight zone episode, except people are around to fix my glasses, and my prescription is so low that if my glasses ever break it will only be a minor inconvenience."
"1644","This Kindle is easy to use and all that I expected of it and more.  The more part is the advertising that is on the the kindle every time you shut it off.  When turning it on you have to swipe the advertisement so it goes away.  I own the kindle now and should not have to see ads every time I want to use my own Kindle."
"1645","Great e-reader for the price. The only problem I can say I have with it is a minor one. It has so little internal storage, about 4GB I think... It is perfect for reading my manga on it too. Just don't expect color on the color pages. Still the images and font is B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
"1646","This is a great device for reading when in the sun.  The size fits well in my purse."
"1647","I've got this Kindle reader for my birthday, but unfortunately had to return it to Amazon since it did not meet my expectations for this kind of a gadget. I'll continue using my iPad for the Kindle app since it's easier to read in a dark place. If I wouldn't have a tablet, then this Kindle may work for me. But it doesn't make sense to have another device which is not better than my iPad."
"1648","My Kindle was a gift, and I enjoy it so much.  It's light in weight which I especially enjoy using when I purchase an author's ""hard cover"" book.  And....the screen is glare free meaning reading with it doesn't bother my eyes or interfere with my sleep."
"1649","It don't light up was a disappointment other wise happy no instruction in it either"
"1650","It worked fine.  It's just that I didn't like the fact that it didn't have a light."
"1651","It took me a long time to get around to buying a Kindle, but I'm really glad that I finally did.  Print size and clarity are about like a trade paperback but it is much easier to hold and the page turns are effortless and practically instantaneous.  I can read much faster on the Kindle and it is very  convenient to be able to look up unfamiliar words on the fly.  It was on sale when I bought it so that made the deal even sweeter."
"1652","I am pleased with my Kindle reader, but haven't had a chance to use it extensively yet."
"1653","It is all I expected, with some limitations, but it is normal since is the cheaper one."
"1654","Great buy, quality is excellent, price is really low compared to other options and the only important feature this model doesn't have is adjustable light, i.e. you can't read without external light. This model is not HD but it doesn't really matter since you can always make the font bigger."
"1655","I bought 2 of these for my kids.  They love them!They are both reading a lot more and really enjoy it!They were a little disappointed that I didn't get them the Fires, but they'll survive!  Maybe next time!"
"1656","I tough that was the paperwhite one... but bought this by mistake at least do the job"
"1657","I bought this for my 87 year old mom for Christmas.  Yes I have had to help her to learn how to use it. But this has been a blessing for her, her eyesight is failiing and she has always loved reading .  She pretty much gave up because she couldnt read the print. Well now we can adjust the font size and the screen is easy for her eyes to read.  Im happy to say she has read six books in January and she loves her kindle. She calls it her machine. LOL  It makes me smile seeing my mom enjoying reading again.  Thanks Kindle  And she is learning and figuring it all out"
"1658","Would like to have more written instructions. Took eleven day for me to get my order."
"1659","My daughter got this as her birthday present, and she LOVES it!  She is thrilled to have a portable device to read books where ever we go!  I'm still trying to figure it out, but she is a pro now!  The one thing I have't discovered yet is if there is a way to control the brightness.  Sometimes it seems very dim.  Otherwise, glad we purchased this!"
"1660","Why don't I get the percentage read of each book. I had it before with my other kindle."
"1661","TECHNICAL REVIEW FOR THE KINDLE PAPERWHITE-  I refurbish old furniture for a living and my Kindle reads to me while I do so.  I've killed many a Kindle, 10 to be exact, and yet I still stand by the little guys.  Why?  Because I have concrete floors in my shop...enough said for the poor kindle I drop on it several times before it breaks.  I've never had one to break because of technical error only my user error- dropping it on the concrete floor.  So, now that you know every Kindle I order shakes in its packaging to be delivered to my shop, let's get down to business.  The only weakness I've been able to find with this kindle is the screen or what is under it to be precise.  It's glass and if you drop it just right- it shatters underneath the plastic top cover making your kindle unreadable but, still working. I've broken the screen and continued to have it read to me until a new one could be delivered.  That's the only weakness.  The case is made of plastic, hard and durable if you buy a cover for it.  I recommend that so you don't scratch the plastic screen if you decide to carry it with you in your purse or briefcase.  It is like a mini laptop in a sense- you have to protect the screen.  Next, the button version of this paperwhite is easy to push, a little small for your fingers but, doable after you learn the ropes of what to push and when.  The touch version is better and easier for a child or senior who has not so steady hands.  It is easy to learn how to work a Kindle.  My child, age 5 when I got my first Kindle, ended up showing me how to work it.  Everything is at the touch of a button or fingertip...there's no complicated programs or adding or removing things.  If you want to connect to Wi-Fi to buy a book, push a button and it takes you there.  That simple.  Your Amazon account is how you pay for a book and because you had to register your kindle, all you have to do is click the buy button and it downloads onto your kindle in less than 30 seconds.  I was in the grocery store last week and downloaded a new book, at a football game, at the doctors office...you get the idea- Anywhere.  This thing has the best Wi-Fi connection I've ever seen!!!!  I live in the sticks of Mississippi...When I say the Kindle can download anywhere, I mean anywhere.  In the middle of the wilderness on a four day camping trip down the Natchez Trace couldn't even stump my Kindle paperwhite's ability to download a book for me.  The app that allows you to listen while the Kindle reads to you-  It takes getting used to the robotic voice but, its a nice feature to have when your hands are full or busy doing other things.  Overall, I give this device five stars."
"1662","Don't really like touch screen. I like my old kindle better.  Still using old one more."
"1663","This is, without a doubt the worst Kindle I have ever used,  This is my seventh Kindle.  It is so poorly designed that it is almost un-useable.The activation button (on-off switch) is on the bottom of the device.  If you try to hold it with one hand, you are constantly turning the device OFF.  Non of the ""Settings"" hold.  In the course of one hour of reading, I have to reset the font size at least 5 times, it won't hold. The page advance touch screen is so course that you either DON'T get a page advance or you turn multiple pages.  The Kindle ""tools"" appear at random when you least expect them.  The location in book settings don't hold,  usually they reset or turn off while you are reading. My over-all rating of this device is PISS POOR!!!  I would rather have my old ""basic"" Kindle to use, at least when you set it up, the settings STAYED WHERE YOU SET THEM, I wasn't a constant battle to keep reading."
"1664","I really like it.  I'm pretty much a real book person, but I have enjoyed this so much!"
"1665","IT WILL NOT HOLD TH SIZE OF THE TYPE. AND I CANNOT READ IN BED AT NIGHT WITHOUI A LIGHT"
"1666","Now that I’ve discovered that the PDF articles can be read in landscape mode, I like this Kindle. I do wish, however, that memory can be expandable through a micro SD card or similar. Overall, this is a good basic reader with a very efficient battery."
"1667","This kindle was given to me as a gift on retiring to a new state. I never had a device like this before. I can read easily off a 15 inch computer screen, but the small format is hard for me. My eyes and reading comprehension don't seem to adjust well to this format. Perhaps you should borrow someones ereader to try out before buying one for your self or asking for it as gift. Maybe I will adjust to the format over time."
"1668","I love it....best kindle I have owned.  Can read it perfectly here in the Texas sunlight."
"1669","I love my Kindle don't get me wrong but I like it to read to me and this model does not."
"1670","I love my kindle and use it everyday.  That said I spend a good time of the day reading books too, so I thought buying a 6"" Glare-Free would be a great way to spare my Kindle charge.  I am so glad I did!  I love the size of this device and the fact that it travels so well and can be used outdoors.  The new print display works really well in all venues and I love being able to carry my ""library"" around with my wherever I go."
"1671","I previously owned a Kinde Fire HD but I wanted a Kindle that I could read books on and not be distracted but other features.  It does what I need it to do.  I do miss having the backlight. Otherwise, I'm fine with it.  It would be nice to have a feature to brighten the screen even just a tiny bit."
"1672","I hate this product. The screen keeps flickering when you turn the page, or go to home or library. I'm definitely returning it. But to be fair, I think this would be a good option if you like sitting outside and reading (like, sitting in the patio/balcony). And it's supposed to be awesome when you're sitting outside in the sun and reading. But I hate sitting outside and I avoid the sun. I do most of my reading while sitting in semi-darkness. So this product is not good for me because the screen is too dark for reading in these scenarios. I'm giving it a 3 and not a 2 because I believe I may not be the typical target for this product. I'm thinking of getting the kindle paperwhile instead."
"1673","It was a christmas gift for my mom exactly what I needed I just need to find a case for it"
"1674","Reading on this is so easy, it looks just like a book, but I can read in much lower light."
"1675","other than not having a built in light I love it. I just didn't buy the right one, my bad"
"1676","Upset that I cant find a case with a built in light for it. Other than that its just fine"
"1677","Did not like it at all. Difficult to figure out, didn't like the pictures of various books."
"1678","Screen too sensitive to touch.  Changes multiple pages unintentionally."
"1679","Arrived quickly. Easy  to  use. Have  had no  problem downloading  my  books  from  my  PC."
"1680","Great for easy reading however there's no backlight so reading in darker areas is difficult"
"1681","For the price it wasn't to bad.However if it had the light bulb feature it would be awesome"
"1682","Feel cheated though -  Bought it for $79.00 and 2 days later, Amazon is selling it for $39."
"1683","My mother loves to read, though in recent years she'd fallen away from it (time, convenience, etc.), so naturally being a Kindle lover myself (I own a former generation with the keyboard), I thought this would be a great gift for her and was able to get a great deal on it during Black Friday this year.I dislike the idea of having ads on the Kindle (relevant or not), but appreciate Amazon's willingness to make the Kindle more affordable than previous models by having the option for ads (which you can pay $20 at anytime to remove, if you so choose). This Kindle is exceptionally more modern than my Kindle Keyboard and was significantly less expensive - that's a win no matter how you look at it.I found the size of it on Christmas morning a huge improvement over my Kindle. It is small and lightweight, yet the screen itself is much crisper and more responsive than my own. The only thing I can fault it with is that the black plastic looks and feels a little brittle and cheap.I helped my mom set it up which was easy enough to do and you're given a brief tutorial upon getting to the home screen for the first time. A lot of the basic concepts from my Kindle carried through to this Kindle (love the touch screen and the mini cover displays on your home screen ""book shelf). However, I really wish Amazon would give a start-up guide in paper form with the Kindle. The user guide on the device itself isn't ideal to learn from and I've had to field several questions from my mother since walking her through it on how to do something. I would argue that despite the better features (especially the ability to click a character's name in a book and be given a biography on them), it's a little less user friendly than previous versions. I'm 29 years old and the learning curve took me a bit, even being a seasoned Kindle user.Even in light of a few minor annoyances, I plan on buying one of these for myself soon. The size and speed of this model will be a great upgrade to my Kindle Keyboard and I absolutely love the ability to borrow Kindle books from my local library.I worry a bit that my mother won't fully utilize her Kindle based on the confusion she's had with the interface, but like everything else in life, practice makes perfect. I have some grievances with the user interface of this Kindle, but it's not enough to dissuade anyone from purchasing it and it remains the best e-reader on the market, and for good reason.My advice to potential buyers is to save $20 by buying the version with ads. They're relatively unobtrusive and many cases have functionality to auto turn on/off the device when the cover is opened, so it makes the ads even less noticeable. Use that $20 to invest in your first few books, and if you find the ads too much to deal with, you can go to Amazon and pay to have them removed. Just my .02."
"1684","Love it!  Lightweight and small enough to fit easily into my purse.  Size and weight make it easy and comfortable to read in bed.  My original Kindle didn't work with our home Wi-Fi, but this one does and makes ordering new books so easy.  So glad I bought it."
"1685","My 13 yr old daughter ordered this to use. It works well for reading, as long as there is light. Unfortunatey it doesn't have a built in light for when it's dark. We've never used an e-reader and found it difficult to understand how to download a book not from Amazon. Also, I was not able to figure out a way to set up an account for her, under my account. I don't like that it suggests books to her based on books I have read. I do like that it does not have a browser or games. We will be returning it and getting the one that has a built in light."
"1686","Can't read in the dark...so returned with no issue and the kindle fire is much much better."
"1687","I like it so far and will probably like it more after I learn how to maneuver it. There are many features that I might not use, but at least they are there it I need them. Light-weight and touch-screen....what a winner!"
"1688","This Kindle does not have a light and while I was disappointed at first it's not really a big deal. Books don't have lights, and I can see the screen as clearly as a book, though the back is grayish and not white like paper, I adjusted quickly. It's better on your eyes as a night-time reader as well. This e-reader was cheap, only $49 on Black Friday sale, perfect for an introductory e-reader.Important detail about E-Readers that I did not anticipate! E-Books aren't aren't cheaper for new releases (older books are for the most part), and Amazon limits your rights to your purchase. You can't share libraries with friends well because your Kindle is synced to a single Amazon account. This is annoying, because I tend to share books with friends and the time limit to borrow a book is two weeks.EDIT: One year later my Kindle is going strong and I have really come to love it. I've upped my rating from 4 stars to 5. I love being able to download a bunch of books from the Kindle store (there's a very good selection of rotating free books). I'm reading more than I have in years and I really like that reading has become part of my nightly routine again."
"1689","I like the touch screen feature on this new generation. Kids are getting this as a gift, so time will tell how they like them, but I am impressed with the ease of use, much improved over last year's model."
"1690","I love it! Now I can pick out favorite books at a much lower cost. I like it because I no longer needto hold a book and flip pages or mark where I left off. My daughter gave this to me as a gift, otherwiseI probably wouldn't have ever gotten one."
"1691","Received as a gift, should have returned for the paperwhite that I was going to buy for myself."
"1692","Miss the page controls and the edges.  Over sensitive to touch, moves content before I am ready"
"1693","Does everything I needed, only problem is the battery not holding a charge very long on games."
"1694","Guess i did not understand the only thing i can do is books. Thought i coyld do games as well"
"1695","I got this on the latest promotion, and it was worth every penny. The newest generation of the e-ink Kindle is outstanding in its screen's responsiveness, I was so impressed with it when I was using it to navigate! I can't wait to dive into some new books!"
"1696","I wanted it to play crossword puzzle games and discovered that it did not work for that purpose."
"1697","Hard to read screen. I expected a brighter display. Should have gotten the more expensive model."
"1698","Enjoy using it very much. Lightweight easy to turn pages.  Would like a few free books .Tk"
"1699","Just received a Kindle w/6"" display. Love the device. I can read all of my books late into the night with disturbing my wife (like I used to w/my laptop). Great product, sorry it took a while before I got one...No issues.  Everyone should have one."
"1700","This is my first E-reader and it's awesome! It came with my amazon account on it so set up was a breeze. Then all I had to do was plug it into my computer and simply upload my books onto it. The books look great and it really does look like real paper! Overall, this is a great E-book and is environmentally friendly (after about 100 books). If you love reading and want to carry your library everywhere, do yourself a favor and buy a kindle- you won't regret it!**** THIS KINDLE IS NOT BACK LIT **** I do not understand why it's such a big deal considering that normal books do not light up!If you really want to read in the dark then buy a clip-on reading light for $8-$20 or buy a Kindle Paperwhite for $119-$210"
"1701","I like it, it works well and there's nothing wrong with it. Just never use it, thought i would."
"1702","I do not know what it looks the Kindle paperwhite or if there is much differences between the KP and the K6, however, I do not have any regret on my K6. I must say that I bought it with an special offer ($50.00) for being an Amazon member, maybe you can wati for this kind of offers to buy one. So, I am happy."
"1703","Easy to use, easy to hold, easy to sync with the Amazon account. You can transfer files directly from your computer as well using a usb cable, and it sports a few file types. If I went back, I would have gotten the higher dpi version, but the lower end version works just fine."
"1704","nice lightweight kindle with original kindle artwork when turned off (after the ad disappears)."
"1705","I really like it but am not sure exactly what model it is?  I bought the water-proof case and a standard case; neither of which fit.  I have to send both back.  They were listed as recommended accessories for this model.  The device itself is great, feels good in my hands, easy to read screen and fonts.  I've had it a week and haven't had to charge it, so the battery life appears good."
"1706","I am ok with my Kindle but I read so much and have for such a long time that I miss turning pages."
"1707","I was not  sure I would like it. but I do. It is very easy to read and I read more books sense I have it. as I can buy 2  for the price of one and I love the sales you have on books . I haven't used your free library yet but I am looking forward to it.. Took it on vacation for easy reading at the beach.in the sun . wonderful. and I don't have to charge it up very often .a great item and a great price . thank you AC"
"1708","Does everything I expected it to. Wanted a reader I could use while sitting outside in the sun. Does not have the same functionality as my kindle fire, but that wasn't what I was looking for since I already have one. Instead, this allows me plenty of pool days and sunshine without having to hide in the shade. Completely satisfied and still amazed at how well I can read my books glare free!"
"1709","HAVEN,T REALLY USED IT AS YET-GOING ON A VACATION AND HAVE ALL THE BOOKS DOWNLOADED-SO READY TO GO"
"1710","Cannot adjust font size or screen  color mode.  Pretty basic compared to other paperwhite readers."
"1711","says it is glare-free but it is not really, cannot use at the beach, and that is why  I bought it"
"1712","it replaced my blank screen original Kindle. There's a little getting used to, but so far so good"
"1713","I have to admit that I really do dislike this new kindle.  I am hopeful that it is just the issue of having to adjust to something new, but I like my old generation kindle with the buttons.  I hope amazon reads these reviews and takes their loyal customers into consideration.  I got lucky and my old kindle started working outside of the case, it never had an issue before, but the case seems to be affecting the battery life as well as the general function of the kindle.  I have had that case for 4 years, and it was never an issue before.  If it continues to work I will reserve this new kindle as an emergency kindle. Otherwise I hope I never have to use it!"
"1714","This is a slick, portable, long last battery E-READER! It does it and it does it very well. Amazon makes solid, easy to use, inexpensive devices and the new Kindle with touch screen is exactly that. You aren't getting a mistasking Apple device with all the bright lights, bells and whistles. I have an iPad, I wanted something that wasn't going to bug me with notifications every three minutes while I'm trying to read. These kindles are quiet, they last a long time between charges; this one is about the size of a mass market paper back. Kindle's app allows for sharing between devices, something that iBooks doesn't allow. For instance if my wife is reading a book on the Kindle, I can read the same book or another book on my iPad mini because of the Kindle app. I wish I would have gotten the Kindle before the iPad because that way all my books would be on all my devices. Instead all my books I purchased in iBooks are stuck on my iPad. Anyway I have only had the Kindle for a short time but I like it mainly because it's easier on my eyes, it was only 50 dollars on Black Friday, it's extremely light weight and I'm not interrupted by all the crap you are able to download with an iPad. It's simple, convenient & cool."
"1715","I received my Kindle for my birthday.  It has brought me such joy.  I love the feature of being able to make the letters larger and easier to see.  I have loaded many books including children books I thought my grandchildren might enjoy reading when visiting.  The touch screen is so nice--just touch and the page turns.  I have read several of my books and have really enjoyed the story lines.  Take my advice, buy a Kindle or one of the many readers that are offered to suit your needs.  You truly will love to read again.Paula Andrews"
"1716","Kind of crappy that amazon charges an extra 40 dollars for a backlit screen but it does the job."
"1717","It would be great if it had a lighted background so you could read in bed without putting a light on."
"1718","Very hard for me to get up and running initially. Why do I need this when I have Kindle on my laptop?"
"1719","Very disappointed at the quality of the product. It's sooooo buggy. When I started up, the screen was non-responsive on the select language page. I tapped many many times until it finally responded and randomly selected French. When I start reading, I find that at certain font size, certain words are chopped off. Another problem I encountered is sometimes I cannot go back to a previous page, I can only go forward! And I bought two of them, both are like that! I'm very shocked at the quality of the product."
"1720","Not very responsive and I do miss having a built in light for nighttime reading. Would recommend a kindle but I would not recommend this version."
"1721","I will keep it short and sweet. I love the size and weight. Easier to hold that a printed book and it is not a light like a tablet that will disrupt your sleeping habits (hopefully) if you read in bed. Down side it the constant ads for glasses, oatmeal, Pokeman, etc. on the power off screen. Now if there is a way to change this, great, let me know. Not sure why I need ads, I paid for this device. Don't I get enough on TV, etc?"
"1722","I am currently looking to replace my kindle, according to amazon it would be a 6th generation kindle, so that is what brought me to this page.  As I read the reviews I knew I needed to speak up in defense of this model.A short history to understand where I come from:  I bought my first kindle in 2009 and gave it to my daughter when she married later that year, it was a 2nd or 3rd generation model. I then bought the next generation model and used it for about 2-2.5 years until I had to replace it because the battery wouldn't hold a charge any more (at that time I used my kindle about 6 hours a day, sometimes up to 12 hours). I then bought the current one in the summer of 2013. This one saw less use because less than a month later my husband got me a kindle fire but still I would have to admit I have given it a work out and now it too no longer will hold a charge.For those who ask why I would use both kindles the answer is simple. As you can see from the above information I read a lot. I read on the way to work, on my break at work, at home sitting in my living room or den, and in my bed at night after my spouse is asleep. I initially took my kindle fire everywhere with me until I found that in bright light it was harder to read that my other kindle, while in dim light I like the display light of the fire. So when I travel to the beach I pack my kindle touch and drag it everywhere, and believe me when I say everywhere, and it has performed without a problem.So End of the story is that now I need to replace that kindle and I believe I'll get another touch.ADD: I've been able to get a hold of a relative's kindle voyage and I really liked it. Why you ask? Because the contrast in sunlight was just as good as my kindle touch but unlike the touch I can read it in the dark without waking up my husband.  The other plus is that unlike my fire the voyage didn't give me eye fatigue, meaning I read it one night without a problem for close to 8 hours where at 4 hours in the dark with the fire I begin to feel the strain. So what am I to do now?? Well right now I'll keep my touch and use the fire in the dark but when the touch goes get a voyage.Oh, and by the way, I get about 24-36 hours of reading time with the wireless off with one charge. This equals a charge about every 3rd day or on long weekend a partial charge every night. This is the same with my fire.  My 2nd gen kindle really did go for weeks, 2 or 3, between charges. My 3rd gen kindle made it about a week.  But my touch seems to lose more charge and I think it's because I sleep it and don't turn it off.  Maybe it would last a whole week if I turned it off every night, but who knows."
"1723","Love it. So much less fuss than my old fire. Less distractions and less glare. I got a little book light so I can read at night since there is no built in light. I only have 4 stars because of even sometimes in the daylight it still seems a little too dim. But it is awesome and came so quickly."
"1724","I absolutely love my new Kindle.  It is so easy to read books on it and it is comfortable to hold.  It also fits nicely on my exercise bike stand so I can read as I ride.  It is perfect and would definitely by again."
"1725","The only thing that is disappointing is that it doesn't have a speaker or earphone attachment.  My other Kindle was able to read to me, while I got ready for work or while driving.  I haven't been able to find my word games that I like to play either.  Other than those things, the screen is wonderful and the ease in getting to the controls is great.  I found myself trying to turn pages on my other Kindle with touch more than once, it is surprising how you get used to the touch screen."
"1726","It's very nice and lightweight. I would have given it more stars if you could read with it in the dark."
"1727","Bought as a gift for my granddaughter. She now has her very own Kindle and doesn't have to monopolize Mommy's. She's a voracious reader, and I don't think she's put it down since she got it. She loves the touch screen and found the interface very easy to learn after using her mother's much older Kindle."
"1728","It is good to read but I realized I wanted a different one after I got it. Its too small for my taste."
"1729","First time kindle user it' s ok, kids like it, only wish it had light can't see anything in low light."
"1730","Enjoying the kindle. The glare screen and dust protector are not easy to use. I have a lot of bubbles!"
"1731","Works best when the user has an amazon account so I would recommend for someone who uses amazon oftenly."
"1732","I have a paperweight and this kindle. The glare free kindle is just a nice to read on as my paperweight."
"1733","would love it but it is the entry unit so a little difficult to use at first but you get  the hang of it"
"1734","the touch screen is a nice feature but it is also the problem. sometimes its not always easy to only touch the edges of a device. your fingers cramp up and you ajust your hand and then you have just made changes. I will have to buy a case or put some kind of protector on the screen to make it easy to read while holding it but have access to the screen to turn pages. This is a good device if you only read at a table and dont have to hold it."
"1735","I can't register my new kindle because of an internal error and can't figure out who to contact. Hello?"
"1736","I love this. It can fit in my purse and u can pull it out and read it anywhere. Even at the beach. Some of the ereaders are unable to be seen when in direct sunlight. I highly suggest this. Especially if you love to read, like myself!"
"1737","This is my second Kindle Touch and as long as it doesn't wear out/die like the first one did after 21/2 years, I'll stay in love with it.  I am a voracious reader, especially at night. So. I guess I just plain wore it out.  My e-reader is a gift from heaven for me as I can no longer hold a book, especially a hardback for long periods of time.  The Kindle came earlier than expected and I had no problem picking it up to find all of my Library in the Cloud and diving right in to my list of ""books to read"".  Thank you."
"1738","Have a Kindle Fire also and bought this unit for vacation to be able to read outside in direct sun light.  Received a good deal on it and although I only use it sparingly it does what I bought it for."
"1739","I don't understand why you'd  take away the games I used to enjoy but otherwise, I like the new Kindle.  There's something about the home screen that seems less appealing than my older Kindle but that's just a personal wierdness that I'll get over.  I was very happy to get this during the National Reading Month sale and I'm glad I spent the money.  The only thing better than one Kindle is two Kindles!"
"1740","Had bought one previously as a gift and wanted one ever since.  Have a Kindle Fire which I love but wanted something to read outside in the daylight without glare and with a longer battery life for reading.  Thought I might miss the backlit screen but not at all.  I don't read in the dark anyway."
"1741","Perfect! I have a nook color and well i love it but wanted a smaller one so since amazon has a lot more cheaper books than Barnes and noble i decided to get this basic kindle. Plus I got a great deal on it. I bought the clip on light and with it I have no problem reading at night or in dark places. So far the battery lasts pretty long."
"1742","Our daughter is loving it.  The options available and the no-glare screen are really nice.  First Kindle."
"1743","I really like the touch screen and the ease with which I can look up definitions and type, as well as get on the Internet. Sometimes it's almost too easy to turn too many pages at once, but I'd rather that be the case from time to time than use the side buttons I used to have.  Thank you for the 7th generation Kindle. It's well worth updating as far as I'm concerned."
"1744","I have been on the fence forever about purchasing a Kindle.  I'm loving every minute of it!  So glad I did!"
"1745","I bought this recently to use this for reading books strickly and this definitely has met my needs and exceeded them. After starring at a computer and phone all day, the last thing I wanted was to read books on another computer screen like device. Having this works perfect and provides the convenience of not having to have multiple books floating around at once. Easy to checkout books from the library and Amazon has great selection to choose from as well."
"1746","It needs a button so I can adjust the light on the words I think outside reading is good but inside to dark"
"1747","Works great"
"1748","Works great"
"1749","Nice and light and reads well in daylight.  I miss the light and should have spent the extra for the fire."
"1750","It does what it's supposed to. Sometimes it's hard to read at nighttime and you definitely need an extra light to see the words, but other than that, it's simple, gives me the books I need, so it's fine."
"1751","This is a fine Kindle. Nothing fancy but meets all the basic needs. I gave it a three because it is a little dim. Since it has no light (which is like a regular book) I would have liked it to be a bit brighter.  However the letters are very clear and of course the font and size is adjustable. I probably would have been happier with the the next one up that has a light, but this was a gift, and a very nice one. As with any hard copy book, just be near a good light source. You can do searches, and make notes, and it has a dictionary, so I'm not really sure what the next one up gives you except for light and a little better resolution. I'd go to a store and see if that makes a difference to you."
"1752","Tends to turn off, go to the wrong place in the book when turned on, or change font size,  if touched on the wrong spot. I would prefer a backlit screen.  I wish Kindle had page nos. displayed rather than percentages.  Going to Amazon & finding books works very well & Kindle Unlimited is a really great deal for me since I read about 20 books per month.I would also like pre-orders to be displayed, or to know how to get a list of what I have pre-ordered, without doing an author search, so I can make sure the funds are available."
"1753","I ordered the Kids bundle for myself and am loving it. I am currently sharing it with the 10 year old but with her reading more with the availability of the Kindle (and Kindle unlimited) I may have to buy her one of her own."
"1754","I am enjoying my new Kindle. I like it's size it fits in my purse, I have found it has been easy to connect with my other Kindle so I have all my books on both. I would recommend it to anyone needing a basic Kindle that has a more useful size."
"1755","This kindle is too complex for my needs.  I preferred my first kindle which was simple.Judith Alexander"
"1756","will not keep a battery keeps downloading and loosing where I leave my place is atonly had it for14 mounths"
"1757","It really is glare free.  I was sorry about that and it doesn't always go to the page I left when reopened."
"1758","I do like this kindle, its easy to use but I wish they would have made it clear that I can charge it from a computer with a USB port and that the battery lasts for several week, otherwise I would not have bought the $15 dollar power adapter."
"1759","I really love my new kindle. I just want to read books and not do anything else. I bought a light that clips on and works great in the dark. Back light is not good on your eyes so I love what I have at a much cheaper price than the kindle fire!!"
"1760","Not the quality of the original kindle.  Instructions are very difficult to follow if they are even available."
"1761","Fun"
"1762","bad"
"1763","I love it!  My Kindle goes with me to the dentist (there's always a wait), doctor appointments and oil and car repairs!  It fits neatly in my purse and allows me to read anything I'm in the mood for.....I'm planning on doing some travelling soon and won't forget my Kindle!!!!"
"1764","The $59 kindle is a bargain.This is my first e-reader and I was undecided on which model to get, so wound up choosing the cheapest one. I have to say i really enjoy reading on it and find it easy to use. The whole process is really easy from setting it up to buying your first book and reading it. The functions are very intuitive and i find myself leaving lots of highlights, notes and book marks to make referencing at a later date painless.The only down side of this product is that it is very basic, so if you are a gadget person, just anti-up and get the kindle fire, which is probably what i will do after i put some miles on the one i have.one really nice feature of the 6"" Kindle is that it will fit in the inside breast pocket of a mens suit jacket, or pretty much any winter coat inner pocket which makes it easy to carry on the train for those of us that don't carry a man-bag around."
"1765","I have always been a fan of reading ""real"" books (hardback/paperback)... until I realized I wasn't reading as much as I would like too. Bought the Paperwhite and I've been reading on the train, waiting in line, walking to a meeting - it's AMAZING! Highly reccomend avid ""real"" book readers to give it a try!"
"1766","I ought this as a gift for my dad, who does not even know how to turn on a computer. Really. I made him an e-mail account to get started and attached his credit card to his account. I showed him how to get books, but paid and the many free novels available, and he was off like a shot! I think I'll have to update his credit card when he gets a new one in a few years, but other than that, he took to this like a duck to water. He loves it!"
"1767","got it for the wife and she likes to read in bed..no backlight is a problem..will return and get the kindle fire"
"1768","just the perfect, simple e reader I wanted...no frills, bells or whistles.....and the price was ever so right!!!"
"1769","I enjoy having it but it no longer has a keyboard. Due to my tremor it is difficult compared to a unit with one."
"1770","Gave to mother in law for Christmas. She seemed excited. It looked good, only complaint- no wall plug in to charge."
"1771","This is my first E-Reader ever so I don't have any other experiences to compare with this product.  But so far, I am thoroughly enjoying using my Kindle even though I am still in learning mode with some of the e-reading functions.  I love the non-glare scree and the print is very clear and easy to read.  At times, I think it would be nice to have a back-lit screen; but I rarely have a need for one.  I love the size of this kindle.  It's lightweight and easy to hold in one hand.  This one includes special offers; but they are not distracting because they only show up when I first open my Kindle.  The low price of $79 (with special offers) is one reason I decided to try this product because I was not sure whether I would like using an e-reader.  I would highly recommend this Kindle to anyone - especially to anyone who has never used an e-reader before."
"1772","the glare free is not the case if you use the small LED light to read by at night, the one I purchared froom  you."
"1773","when i bought this it never said you wouldn't be able to adjust the screen brightness!  for almost a hundred bucks it should have that feature! I never would have purchased anything that you can't adjust the shade of the pages. If it were the same color pages as a real book that would be one thing, but this is dull grey and I have to squint to read it which is NOT good if you have glaucoma because squinting raises eye pressure! I spent a few wasted hours trying to figure out how to make the screen brighter only to figure out it isn't possible. I am mad that I wasted alot to buy this, only to not be able to use it, I have tried to GIVE it away and as soon as anyone sees the screen they don't want it, not even for free!"
"1774","The screen is laggy, and the screen freezes sometimes, but at least I can read when the sun shines on the surface."
"1775","This is my first E-Reader and I love it. I have had it for 7 days and already went through almost 5 books with it."
"1776","Great for being the entry level, love the package for the kids, especially removing the ads. Defn a viewable ""step down"" from the paperwhite or having lights for reading, but for trying to see if the kids would even like it, being on a budget, it is excellent. Local library system doesn't have the simplest way of doing things, but at least the Kindle is up to date that it auto-loads it and no hooking up USB cables to download like before. Never having them, I still already miss some of the features of the upgrades, understanding why, but the kids are ecstatic and can't put it down. I'd buy it again."
"1777","I did have kindle on my phone and tablet, but the bright screen always bugged me when reading for long periods. Then, at the behest of my parents constant praise for their kindles, finally caved in and bought for myself. And I have finally seen the light. I read even more now. I love that I am able to research words and people and things at the press of the screen. My favorite product (at the moment). I take it everywhere. Before, my phone and current events were my go to while waiting. Now, I am lost in my kindle and will often let people cut in front of me so that I can finish a page (or chapter)...hahaha. Can't wait for this one to break so that I can upgrade to the paperwhite."
"1778","Effective basic reader. Common USB for charging. I wanted the non-backlight feature for minimal eye strain and it is perfect for that. I own iPads but didn't want the light in my face for hours with longer reading materials. The contrast is excellent.  The resolution is totally fine even though it is the lowest of the kindle line up - it's already twice common screen resolution, basically, and I read that all day without complaints.  It's less responsive than an iPad, lesser hardware for sure, but does it's simple job very well and distraction-free."
"1779","One of my most favorite summer activities is floating in my pool and reading a great book.  My children purchased this item for me for my birthday and I have  used it every day since.  It is glare free and lightweight as promised .  The book purchasing process easy as pie.  I am thrilled with my kindle!"
"1780","It sure is a great device meeting my expectations. It was given to me as a Christmas present and I am very please with it. I have a tablet too so having the basic Kindle is nice for one thing the battery last for a long time."
"1781","Nice, light device. After having a Kindle Paperwhite I was rather disappointed with the lack of a backlight for the screen, but once I got used to it and how nicely it displays in even very low light, I like it better."
"1782","I love it!  It's easy on your eyes.  When you spend most of your day staring at the computer screen,  it's nice to be able to sit and read without the eye strain and glare.  I've had no issues with page turning.  The ads only pop up when you wake it."
"1783","My daughter is very happy white this sh loves to read and save our book case I was running out of room for her books"
"1784","I bought it for a trip overseas and it was perfect. It makes reading while traveling enjoyable and easy. My favorite feature is the tap motion to turn a page. It is light and easy to transport.Great buy if all you want to do is read!"
"1785","I just received my new kindle 6 touchscreen last week after using Amazon's trade in program.  So far I really like it.  Battery lasts long.  Screen is very clear.  Directions were fairly easy to follow so no problems getting my books transferred to the new one.  I know others have complained about  not having a light to read by, but there are cases you can buy if you really want that option .  Only thing I miss is not being able to use my old games on this device.  But I knew this was a reader only when I purchased it so I am happy with my choice"
"1786","I loved my kindle, it doesn't have a back light and I hadn't realized that until AFTER I bought it (I was in a bit of a rush very excited). I however lucked out and had the chance of getting the Fire on sale the following week for late night reading.However this is everything I was hoping it would be. It's light, compact, and most of all does its main function of being an eReader. I would only change one thing that I've noticed with this and other kindles my friends and family have. When you switch screens it looks a bit glitchy, those that have one will notice what I mean.Another thing I wanted to touch on being a huge bargain shopper is that 80% of the time you'll find kindle books to be a lot cheaper than the physical competitor! In the future I'll be purchasing one with a built in backlight because I just love this one so much."
"1787","I like that I can change font sizes; I couldn't on my first (very basic) Kindle that I literally wore out.  I'm not crazy about ""touch screen""....  but that's my problem.  I'm still getting used to touch screen on other devices too.  (I keep going back a page, when I really don't mean too....  my fingers in wrong place?)"
"1788","Now, I wish I could quit losing these things.  Off to buy another one! Mine seem to be eaten by airplane seat pockets."
"1789","I donot like the fact you cannot adjust the light on the background,  it is impossible to read without a lot of light."
"1790","it's only fine... not so easy to use if you want to read your own document. perhaps i just put too much expectations ."
"1791","Comparing a Paperback to this Kindle in regular daytime room light.  I find this Too dark.  Much prefer a  paperback."
"1792","After my first generation Kindle died, I had to replace it. While the touch-screen is great in theory, in practice it can be a bit annoying as the slightest touch can flip a page. I also find that if I press too hard while turning a page, the Kindle will jump forward 2, 5, sometimes 15 pages. It gets annoying. I do like how quickly this Kindle charges and how long it holds a charge."
"1793","I love this device. The battery is awesome, I charged it once overnight and it is still halfway down, 2 weeks later, even after reading an average of 3 hours a day. Reading enhancements (word wise, translator, x-ray, dictionary) work flawlessly. This is an entry level Kindle, so no built in light -- if I were buying it again, I would get the paperwhite model."
"1794","I haven't had my Kindle for long, but I really enjoy it! It's super light, easy to read, and the touchscreen works much better than I expected. The page turns are fast, at least compared to my old Kindle Keyboard. My only complaints are minor, for example, landscape mode only goes one way (the bottom of the device is on the left side), but like I said, very minor issue. So far I think the biggest issue I have with it is that the back is harder and has less grip than my Kindle Keyboard. It makes it a little harder to hold, but I'm sure if it causes a big problem you could get a case for it. All that considered, I think that the price is really what kicked it up to 5 stars for me. This is a really good deal, and I'm super happy with my new Kindle!"
"1795","I may have received a refurbished unit, the name says Andy's 2nd kindle. What the heck? Edit: It is confirmed that I was sent a refurbished unit. I have full access to the users cloud and ability to purchase books. I can't believe first that I was sent a refurbished unit and second that it still had the users information on it!"
"1796","Unless you are sitting in an area with bright sunlight you will not be able to read this. I was very excited to get my first Kindle but returned it the same day it arrived. The screen is a blackish grey that makes for poor visual reading. I may try another type of Kindle but not this model. I guess it is true what they say...you get what you pay for. The glare-free screen is of no value if you cant see the screen properly."
"1797","This is exactly what I was looking for, no frills just function! I would recommend paying a bit extra to remove the ads."
"1798","Browser froze and stayed frozen.No access to Amazonor other web sites.Reviewer is sloppy typist. Not Kindle's fault."
"1799","It's my fault, I purchased wrong item so it is not what I wanted originally.  Cannot give an ""unbiased"" opinion."
"1800","If you are looking for a simple and well price kindle then this is the one for you. It is just the basic and does not have a built in light or web access but it is perfect for anyone just looking to read books on it."
"1801","Disappointed that Amazon makes a new version of the Kindle that does not have an internal light feature but doesn't have a cover with a built in light available for purchase.  Customer service was also incredibly lacking in knowledge of this fact and it took me 10 minutes of restating my question about this before they could confirm that there is not currently a cover with a built in light feature to accompany this Kindle.  I have not complaints about the Kindle itself but expected that they would have accessories available to go along with it."
"1802","I love my Kindle. It's small, compact and has great battery life. With the Prime Lending library, I've found myself reading more. Easy to read while sitting outside at the beach and easy to use. Perfect."
"1803","I bought it for my niece for her 10th birthday party - she is in love with it. It's easy to use and seemingly kid friendly. This kindle has the ability to turn on Parental Controls, so we turned off the ability to download books from the kindle and access the internet. She's an absolute book worm, so this was perfect. It wasn't fancy, and she still is able to read as she wants to."
"1804","I knew this was a simple version of a Kindle but was disappointed there is no light for reading in bed. Otherwise it's okay."
"1805","Only complaint is I wish I could brighten the screen, I don't have that functionality on my Kindle, like others I've seen."
"1806","Being new to paperless book idea I found the Kindle easy to set up and use. I enjoy reading a light weight device that I can use to carry a ton of books to my favorite reading spots. I like the adjustable text size, paper-like appearance and fast download speed as well."
"1807","This Kindle has a couple of quirky features that drive me crazy, i.e., you can't TURN IT OFF, and it displays an image when you need to charge your battery but does not tell you what percentage your battery is on so that you know when to stop charging!  I think the engineers need to slow down and pay attention to detail."
"1808","The 6"" model is pretty small. If you have good lighting and good eyes (or glasses) you can make the text pretty small, but when I read in bed the lighting forces me to use larger type so I only get about 1 paragraph per page. It is slower turning on and updating than I expected, but it is acceptable."
"1809","I can't get my new kindle to connect to my WiFi. It worked for an hour one night, but sporadically. Since that time not at all."
"1810","I am very satisfied with my new Kindle e-Ink.  I almost bought the Paperwhite, but decided against it because of the reviews (known backlight issue). I know technology constantly changes, but I am with some of the other reviewers:  the touchscreen is too sensitive, I want the page turn buttons back.  Other than that, I love my Kindle!!"
"1811","I like it but when I download library books the process seems more convoluted than I think it should be. I have to go through my laptop or iPad through Overdrive to get to the Kindle.  I think you should figure out how to make it easier.  Also, when I hold the reader in the horizontal position with my right hand I would prefer to hold it by the fat end rather than the skinny end.  To me it just makes sense being right handed like most people.  Maybe you could work on that."
"1812","Absolutely love it! Great product, great price.  I take it with me everywhere. I had a lot of the free classics like Zane Grey westerns and Sherlock Holmes from Amazon which I set up from my laptop several years ago. Now I can read them on the Kindle. To add them to this Kindle only costs 99 cents."
"1813","I bought this on cyber Monday for a gift for my mom for mothers day. Upon turning it on for the first time it was in chinese! We had to call customer service and talk to them for about 20 minutes and we were able to figure out how to put I in English. NOW it won't charge! I'm so frustrated that a BRAND new device is having so much trouble."
"1814","I really like the kindle. I just did not like that there is no lighting options. I wanted to be able to read it in all settings."
"1815","Love it.  Need to come up with a ruggedized version since I've broken so many of these due to my own negligence over the years."
"1816","some written directions or an easier to find help line would have helped a lot , very disappointed arrived with no directions ."
"1817","This was a nice replacement of my older kindle which I dropped recently.  It is a little smaller than my old one but still easy to read and actually lighter.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 as I found getting back to the menu difficult, but that could just be me getting use to the touchscreen and the way this one functions.  Also while swiping is easy I did grow use to using the buttons on the side of my old kindle to turn the page as my fingers were already there so I barely had to move.Overall it is a great product and a worthy replacement, my prejudice and star reduction is mostly related to being more comfortable with some of the features of my older one.  I would recommend one especially if you do a lot of book reading.  I check out lots of kindle books from my library so that is an added plus."
"1818","I got this for the Black Friday price which is a good price point for a gift for my 8 year old daughter. We travel a lot and this is the perfect way for her to load some books without the bulk of ""real"" books. I like having my own tablet without having to loan it to her. This one truly is hers and it's fun for her to borrow books from the Kindle lending library (we're Prime members). At this price, if something happens to this Kindle, it's not a big investment. It's good for what she's using it for which is only books."
"1819","Just got this Kindle and I am sooo happy to have it. Reading with this device is so much easier on the eyes than a tablet. I would highly recommend for anyone who reads a lot. The size is great and it is so light. I am more than pleased."
"1820","I love this Kindle. I have an iPad and an iPhone, but I wanted a device that would only be used for books. I didn't want the Kindle Fire because I need something with the batter power to last as long as this Kindle's does.It doesn't light up.  I specifically chose this Kindle BECAUSE of that. Lighted screens would detract from battery life.  This device will go a month on a single charge.I love the touch screen and font sizer. Do I sometimes fumble and turn a page?  Yeah, but so what?  I can simply turn back to where I was. No big deal. My son has an older model Kindle, and the thumb pad directional button is annoying to me.In my opinion, for the money and features, you can't beat this generation of Kindle.  If you just want a reliable, long-lasting device for reading, look no further. Skip the bells and whistles.  Let's read a book."
"1821","i was sorry that I cannot play word games on my new kindle. I tried to get that information before I bought but it was not clear.."
"1822","Too small for reading. Especially in portrait modeScreen blinking. For example when you switch from dictionary back to book"
"1823","NOT GLARE-FREE"
"1824","I LIKE IT BUT WISH IT HAD PAGE NUMBERS ON THE BOOK I READ,,"":WHEN EVERY THING CHANGED""  THE kINDLE IS STILL VERY NEW TO ME."
"1825","It is very small!  I guess I had expected this new Kindle to be a little larger than the older one.  It doesn't seem much different."
"1826","Really haven't used it that much after my original Kindle died.  Have been listening to audio books since then.  But, it seems fine."
"1827","Not as well lit as I would like.  Will continue to use my Fire HD when at home, and take the glare free to the car wash, salon, etc."
"1828","As a first user of this kindle, I can say that this item full fill my expectations. Is easy to read my favorites books and save them up into the cloud, thats make that the internal memory no need to be used"
"1829","Amazing, i thought the small size (In comparison to the kindle keyboard Gen2 my previous kindle) would dampen reading for me but it still has the right size for text and correcting to your preferences, very light simple to look at and very nice. Much more cost effective to get this kindle and a $15 case with a light than it would've been to get the kindle paperwhite (50 dollar difference for a backlight) and then buy a 25+ dollar case.No complaints so far love it a lot."
"1830","Since this is my fourth Kindle, I obviously love Kindles.  I don't like the fact that they're continually being updated, making the Kindle and its accessories obsolete.  I have a beautiful leather cover for my first one which I can't use anymore because it doesn't fit the newer ones.  I don't like the touch screen on the new Kindle.  Much of that can be remedied by my getting used to the new features.  The screen is much more sensitive than I'd like.  I touch it accidentally often, when I'm just reading or when I'm carrying it to another room.  It doesn't just go to the next page, it moves several pages ahead (or back), so then I have to find my place again.I've wondered about getting my original Kindle refurbished.  Do you do that for customers?  At any rate, I have no intention of giving up my Kindle.  I love the availability of hundreds of books, and the convenience of carrying one small volume.Thank you.Dorothy McIntosh"
"1831","This is my 3rd Kindle. The script is easier to read, but navigating is seriously more difficult than my second kindle. There are fewer prompts and their meanings are difficult to decipher. A written instruction sheet would also be very helpful."
"1832","My original Kindle died, when I called to see if it could be fixed the person I spoke with said no and suggested this would be very close to the one I had.  It is not close at all, I will in time get use to it but I am not happy with it."
"1833","travel a lot,bring this when you in the waiting room before boarding and during the flight.It lasts more hours then ipad. Like it"
"1834","My family has loved every Kindle product we have bought and this is no exception!  Easy to set up, easy to use, hours of reading time!"
"1835","Wait.. I like the Kindle, but I DO NOT LIKE buying one and being automatically signed up for Amazon's Kindle Unlimited and then having to remember to come back and cancel it before they keep charging my credit card monthly.  If I want Kindle Unlimited, let me check a box or sign up after 30 days, don't tell me you are just going to start auto charging. I am getting tired of this sneaky corp crap.  Keep it up and I may decide I don't need a Kindle or Amazon.Ugh, and what is this 'Promotional Amount' that results in a 'Deferred Payment' when I try to check out?  Is this a layaway plan or something?  Where was any of that explained in the Kindle page?"
"1836","Work great with glare resistance screen however I can't read at night without a light. If Amazon added a light, would be better - 5 stars"
"1837","I have a kindle fire also, but I prefer this for reading, especially outside.  My daughter got me this for my birthday!!  Great gift idea"
"1838","This is awesome for when my hands become cramped or numb. I just set it where I can read it easily which is great because I love to read."
"1839","I bought the Kindle  for my 11 year old son because he did not like to read. Now he love reading on his Kindle....he does not put it down"
"1840","Simple, light weight, no glare, long battery life.  If you read this in a dark place then you would be better off getting the model above which is the paperwhite with the backlight.  Also, I get the NYT newspaper app and my only complaint is that it doesn't download until later on in the day instead of first thing in the morning."
"1841","I bought this to replace my third broken Kindle device. I know it's crazy but I like the device so much that I decided to replace it again.When I contacted Customer Service they were very helpful but only offered the version that is backlit or a Kindle Fire as a replacement. I do wish the screens were less fragile. Apparently, the slightest mishap can irreparably damage the screen so I've decided to bite the bullet, replace the device and treat it like it's made of eggshells. Wish me luck."
"1842","I'm learning to like it. But I feel I didn't do enough product investigation. The size it really a handy feature. But no backlight is a pain."
"1843","Very hard to work to go back to the book you were reading"
"1844","I had never bought one of these before, so I was hesitant about getting one. I had so many e-books stored on my computer, it was slowing it down. I had to buy one out of necessity. I thought it was going to be difficult to get all my books on it, but it was so easy! The instructions are so simple to follow, and it pretty much walks you right through the setup and installation process. The battery life lasts a LONG time, as I don't think I've put it down for more than an hour since I got it! I put it on charge at bedtime, and the battery, after a full day of reading, has barely been used. I highly recommend this product, especially in the bundle pack, for anyone who is addicted to reading books! I can't believe I waited so long to get one!"
"1845","This is our second Kindle, I am still learning all the capabilities.  It is handier than our original Kindle.  It shortens some of the procedure (password to commence is not required).  The longer battery life is nice.  It is a little harder to delete a sample or book."
"1846","A perfect simple reader it is. I love how neat and light it is, its touchscreen works much better than that on Nook Simple Touch I used to have. An experimental browser works fine, too. One of my fav functions is the ability to send docs via email, the device syncs fast and smoothly. I feel like there are many more functions, I just need to take my time and discover them : )Overall, great experience!"
"1847","I liked my kindle with button keyboard better. Also this new one has pics of books instead of listing them. And I can't tell what they are !!?!"
"1848","This really is the best e-reader out there. Perfect for those who work with LCD screens all day and want to give their eyes a break before bed."
"1849","I guess I'll learn how to use it eventually.  This is very different from holding a book though.  Maybe I'm just old-fashioned because I'm old."
"1850","I like it a lot"
"1851","Love the Kindle, size is great but I HATE the advertisements. Can this be turned off? You even have ads that are offensive to me! Please help!"
"1852","Screen could be a little lighter but this is still great! I have never had a e-book reader before so i deciced to start having a new one. As a starting point, i found this gadget very very useful. Highly recommended!"
"1853","Just really started playing with it but can tell you that it is fast and the screen resolution is excellent. Changed from an original 7"" fire to this and was worried about the size making it tough to read, but the higher resolution more than makes up for it.  Strikes me as a good deal for the price and I'm glad I bought it."
"1854","As someone who loves to read in their free time, the Amazon Kindle has been an awesome product for me. This product is very durable and efficient, as I have already dropped it a couple of times and it does not have a scratch on it. It has been wonderful to have all of my reading materials (magazines, books, and newspapers) in one place. It will also be very helpful for family vacations, and for my parents to take on business trips. It has been very convenient to always have one item where my reading materials are stored. The battery life has also been outstanding, lasting almost weeks at a time. Compared to other products on the market, there is no glare on the screen when you are reading in the sun. This made a huge difference to me as I do most of my reading outside.Technology aspect-I am someone who does not need to have all the apps and games that some products offer with their reading devices, so if you are someone who is tech savvy, this product might not be for you. It is very straightforward and easy to use, which makes it perfect for me, as I have never been very good with technology.Kid Friendly- In my opinion, if you are looking for an e-reader, do some research before you purchase the product. I thought the Kindle was a good value for the price of $79.99, as there are many different Kindle products and competitor products that are much more expensive. This is especially if you are looking for an e-reader for a child, you may have hesitated before because of the price. With this model only being $79, you may have found your perfect product. One bonus is that the screen size is the same as the other Kindle devices, so you are not losing out on that if that is something that is important to you.One thing to keep in mind is that there is no buttons besides a power button. Turning the page is as easy as taping the side of the screen.In comparison to other products, this Amazon Kindle has been perfect for me because it is easy to use, easy to read in the sun, and easy to store when taking it places."
"1855","This new touch screen is the worst thing I have ever seen.  Sometimes it turns one page, sometimes two, sometimes 10 , sometimes you don't know how many and can't find your place.  Once a tap sent it to the end of the book giving the references.  You can accidently touch a word with your left hand and this 3/4 screen thing pops up  trying to define a word,  etc. and there is no obvious way to get rid of it.The old buttons of the side was reliable.I am throwing this in the trash today."
"1856","Reading has always been my passion (I was 4 when my mother started to take me to the library). When in 2013, after many eye surgeries, I had difficulty reading, I purchased my firstKindle Paperwhite. It is wonderful! Being able to adjust type size and contrast and having such a great choice of reading material made such a difference! I may soon may be purchasing another.Plus, here's a little-known benefit for those of us who live where there are frequent power outages, whether man-made or weather-related - you can keep reading when the power goes out! (Does anyone out there remember sneaking a silver-and-black flashlight with sizs D batteries under the cover so that they could keep reading after lights-out???)I think I might be buying another Kindle Paperwhite in the near future.FYI: There are many out-of-copyright books available for free download!"
"1857","didn't know special offers meant with advertisements, My Bad"
"1858","I have sent the Kindle back as it did not meet expectations."
"1859","It is exactly what I expected and I'm glad I ordered it. The touch screen upgrade is so much better than the button version. The case also seems sturdier. For an economical and compact e reader, this one meets all my needs!"
"1860","This is my first kindle. It SAVE MY EYES! My eyes get itchy and dry when reading from a phone screen.  If you read a lot from phone screen, you should buy one.I bought a 2nd hand one and It's look like brand new.  It's totally okay for me that it's not include a power adaptor. I always charge it on my computer.It doesn't have light on it. You shouldn't read in dark environment so it's not a problem.But the screen response has turned slow after a month of using it. It took times to turn pages, Sometimes I guess maybe it didn't sense my tapping so I tap once more time and it turns 2 pages.  This makes me frustrated.  (Update: okay. I found out I needed to restart it to keep it function smoothly, not just 'screen off''.)"
"1861","It is a great upgrade from the previous version, the touch screen is pretty good, took a minute to figure out a couple of the new features.  Overall if you'd like an inexpensive kindle this would be it.  The only thing that bugs me is that it doesn't have the contact points for an external light like the old one for the lighted case.  Small issue."
"1862","I bought the Kindle after much deliberation at the suggestion of a friend. I had wanted to start reading books electronically, but found that reading them on an iPad or my computer monitor was simply a disastrous notion, as my eyes would quickly become dry, itchy, and tired. I did a lot of research online and saw that the technology behind the Kindle screen was much different, but the idea of a screen that does not keep refreshing itself was odd to me. I thought it would just look like the slow-moving screen of my old Palm Pilot.To my surprise, this device is absolutely amazing. As long as the lighting is adequate, it is just like reading a book. The battery holds a charge for a long, long time, and the software (a detail which a nerd like me cares about) is actually quite full-featured. You can make purchases directly from the device, you can connect it to your Goodreads account, and it even has a modest, built-in web browser. Basically, it includes some completely painlessly functioning online features that make it a pleasure to use. If I buy books on my computer, the next time I open the Kindle it immediately loads the new items into its inventory.The Kindle has exceeded my expectations in every conceivable way."
"1863","good"
"1864","good"
"1865","good"
"1866","It's very light weight, which I like.  I do wish the screen could be lightened so I could read in bed at night without lights being turned on.  So I use my Kindle Fire at night and the e-reader during the day."
"1867","Dropped my 3rd generation kindle around Thanksgiving, but I was still able to see the page when I increased the font. Then, you guessed it, the blackness spread until I could no longer read nor operate the kindle. I read the reviews for the kindle 7, especially the one and 2 starred reviews, and with no choice I purchased the kindle 7. No need for the backlight or the Fire, just wanted to read.  I was so apprehensive about the newer kindle that I dreaded opening the box. Not sure the people that wrote a 1 or 2 star review actually purchased the same reader because the instructions were so simple, and maybe, just maybe the whole ordeal of opening the box, setting up the Wi-Fi and downloading my books took 15 minutes. Everything worked, the cloud is easy to access. pages are simple to turn. If you are an avid reader, you can turn off the annoying dictionary; its an option, not a necessity. The kindle is a pleasure to read a book, turn  a page, find a page or adjust the settings.  The main reason I gave the kindle a 5 star rating is because my wife and I can now read and download each others books. What a great improvement, sharing a book. There are many improvements, haven't gotten to them all as of this moment, but when I do I will realize again and again what a great reader this 7th generation is to own!!!!!  PS- the price was right as well"

"1874","Bought it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. Maybe I missed it upon ordering it, but maybe it should be bundled to include a protective case  when first purchased. i'm going to get one for her now, but it's definitely an awesome buy for the value."
"1875","In technical books, the diagrams/pictures don't show up clearly, the zoom out on the diagrams/pictures don't zoom making it difficult to read. It is otherwise built well, very handy, light weight, long battery life, good UI.Making notes also is not that flexible, does not have a pen that comes with it. Could be worth the price,  but look for something better"
"1876","I love this Kindle!!!  I originally had the one with the keyboard at the bottom, but it eventually died. I read every night so I wanted to replace it right away. The 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen has met all of my expectations and more!!  It did not take me long to learn the basics and I am still learning as I use it. I love the size and it is very lightweight.  I would highly recommend this Kindle if you love to read!!!"
"1877","I am very happy with this Kindle.  Easy to operate and easy to read.  I purchased a folio case for this Kindle and really like that the Kindle opens when I open the case and closes when I close the case"
"1878","good"
"1879","Nice"
"1880","Cool"
"1881","Disappointed in my Kindle.  I haven't had it a year yet and already it does not work.  It will not download any books and the battery runs out in just a few hours.  I worked great when I first got it. I would think it should last more than a year before it dies.  Not impressed.  I won't buy another one."
"1882","good"
"1883","All I needed, my old kindle had buttons and after so many years the letters wore off. The touchscreen is great. Old kindle still works great though if not for buttons. Just the perfect e reader,is all I needed,. Love it!"

The backpack is a lot lighter now!He keeps track of his own reading, and I personally love the clues that appear automatically in the reading according to his age."
"1895","Love it! I had a fire but found most of the features were redundant with my notebook and iPad (although the user interface was inferior) .This is exactly what I needed, a small ( pocket sized) device that I can use to read both indoors and out."
"1896","A+++"
"1897","Love it! I never had a Kindle reader before, and was really looking forward to owning one and using it. When I got this one, I used it right a way and really loved it. Now I take it with me to the gym and read using it while I'm on the bike or some other activity that does not require concentration much. Really recommend it. One thing I found that could use some improvement, is that the resolution is not perfect. I think it could be better for sure."
"1898","I really like it.  It is more user friendly than my kindle w/keyboard as far as searching for new books.  I also like the touch screen versus the side page turn buttons.  I was always hitting buttons accidentally while holding it and I don't have that problem with this.  It is smaller so it fits in my purse a little better.  The screen is easy and clear to read on.  This type of kindle is easier on my eyes than a backlit screen which is why I stuck with the original type of kindle.I do have to mention that after a little looking around, I was unable to find a case with a light in it for this version.  I m going to take a look at the paper white due to this reason. Although I really love this kindle touch, the unavailability of a lighted case will likely change my mind about it."
"1899","Good"
"1900","good"
"1901","You may argue that you can read it over phone, but the point is that Kindle is made for books. For people who look to build in their own library , it may or may not be worth, but definitely for me, I carry my library with me."
"1902","Good"
"1903","Very"
"1904","I previously had an old version of a Kindle so when that stopped working this was a great replacement.  It's easy to use andthe white back round makes the print jump off the page.  I prefer to keep all my reading materials on a Kindle because of the glare factor when reading outside.  Unlike  tablets, it's never a problem.  I would recommend this to anyone.When you place this is a protective case with a cover, it's like reading any book."
"1905","This works very well for my daughter...when it actually works! I love Kindles, and have bought myself two so far. My family and I live overseas in Singapore, so I got my 9-year-old daughter a Kindle in order to get access to books we cannot get here, as well as for convenience when traveling. She loves it, but it freezes constantly and take about a day and many tricks to unfreeze it. She gets extremely disappointed and frustrated when she is in a good part in her book and then the Kindle freezes, meaning she must put it aside for at least a day. I don't know if this is a glitch with this particular model, since I've never had this issue with my Kindles and when I search it on forums I find that many others have this issue, but they need to look into it and fix it. I will be very unhappy if I have to buy her another Kindle to replace this one, which is only 6 months old."
"1906","Lots of nice features, such as X-Ray to remind me who the characters are, dictionary, time left in chapter and book, location, page number and of course, touch page turning .  Plus, it was easy to download books from my first Kindle.  I love it and will be giving it for Christmas (again)."
"1907","Excellent product. My only regret is that it does not allow me to use the cover for my previous device. Apart from that, the device itself is superb."
"1908","I guess I was spoiled by my Paperwhite, which I misplaced, to downgrade to this Kindle.  It works okay but I forgot how much I used the backlighting."
"1909","too sensitive eo touches, I loved my original non toucg kindle it was simple to use,after three years of use it finanale gave up, much to my sorrow."
"1910","I do like it and it is so convenient to take along on office visits where I have to sit for a time at times. Fits in my purse so don't have to carry a book along with my appointment book. Easy to use."
"1911","My first Kindle was the original one --Don't know what you call it but I had a cover with a light.  I had it for over five years not a lick of trouble but then I dropped it in the parking lot. I had to get another one right away so I went to Staples.  My budget only allowed for the smallest paperwhite.  I love the touchscreen and especially love the dictionary and the xray features  The thing about this one is that it is lighter and I am surprised at how much better that is..  I purchased a cover for 15 bucks which I had to have because I didn't want to break my precious Kindle again."
"1912","I had my last Kindle for years and it was with me through more than 150 books.  Can't say enough good things about this device.  Easy to use and read, long battery life, ridiculously portable, durable (with a case), encourages reading, etc."
"1913","Despise the Ads."
"1914","Debated with myself for years about getting a Kindle. Have the app on my phone which I use daily. Having received an Amazon gift card for Christmas I decided to finally pull the trigger. Bought the basic model because I'm cheap. Hindsight being 20/20 I should have gotten the ""paperwhite"" because of the light. I'm giving my model a 5 star rating because it does everything as advertised."
"1915","Great product with a lot of user flexibility...just one complaint: No backlight??? The one detriment to being able to read is the lack of light, so I would think that this would have been a primary consideration."
"1916","I purchased the new Kindle for my mother. This is an upgrade from her current Kindle, the 2nd Generation ""white Kindle"".We/she is still getting used to the new Kindle; however, as of now, I see issues with the Wi-Fi connection, as the new Kindle does not seem as responsive and loses the single.  Mom may be set in her ways, but she is trying the new touch screen vs the buttons.The transition from old to new isn't that difficult, in my opinion anyway.  Mom and I are learning together.You can teach an old dog, new tricks!"
"1917","This was a replacement for one I lost. While the screen is the same size, the overall size is smaller and more convenient. One the other hand, I occasionally enjoyed using the audio output of my previous model."
"1918","This review is for my Kendall Kendall not the tablet that they try to sell me Square Deal company do not buy from them I love my Kindle it works fine"
"1919","I even like the box it comes in. I store my Kindle in it and carry it around in my backpack like a actual book.. It's convenient and protect my screen. For reading I just open the box and turn it on. Awesome. I really do love it."
"1920","I love this Kindle . Only problem , it isn't glare-free . It has less of a glare than a regular tablet , but there is still some glare that gets through ."
"1921","I have debated getting a Kindle for a long time, but was never sure I wanted to give up on holding a real book and turning real pages. Well, I finally decided to try the basic Kindle, and I am pleasantly surprised how much I enjoy reading on this. I definitely read more now that I have the Kindle. It's comfortable to hold, there is zero eye strain, and overall usability is excellent. Having so many cheap or free books available through Kindle deals has already increased my Kindle library substantially. I bought a Fintie Folio Case and they are a great fit.Screen: excellent, clear, no eye strain, easy to readTouch: excellent, intuitive, responsive, turning pages happens subconsciously nowCasing: good, plastic, but not uncomfortable, maybe would have preferred a little matte finish for gripSpeed: responsive, no lag, page turns do not noticeably flash like the Kindle keyboard I tried out from a friend, which was distractingAs a former Kindle skeptic, I would recommend this to anyone who isn't sure they want to give up on real paper. I am very happy with my purchase."
"1922","This Kindle is fantastic.  I had another device for several years and loaned my device and over a 100 books to a Peace Corps volunteer.  The Kindle is far superior.  I love the way i can change the text settings to larger or smaller depending on my eye fatiegue."
"1923","Really ticked. I swore I'd never buy another reader because they don't last long in my experience. However, I love to play every word and another game as a stress reliever. You can't play games in this version. Really should make that clear in the description. I could've just kept using my iPhone to read. Waste if money."
"1924","I love how light it is after some of my heavy tablets.  Its easy to read.  Had it shipped while on vacation, so I enjoyed it while on vacation when I had more time to read.  Bought lots of books and cookbooks.  Thanks for a nice reader.  I love the long battery life.  Wish my other devices had a battery to last that long."
"1925","I had been considering getting a Kindle product for some time, but was unsure if I would use it and enjoy the alternative to traditional books. First I debated between this version of the Paperwhite, I decided I didn't want to spend the extra $ for what is essentially a light and I have been very happy with this version.  It feels light but not fragile in hand, and reads very well under normal lighting conditions.Downloads via Wifi are speedy and browsing the Kindle store is very straightforward.  The only  downside is now I'm spending a ton of money on books!  It's been a great resource to have, and it really is a good deal.  I highly recommend it!"
"1926","Can`t use it.  Only bringsup reviews by chapter. You charged me 9.99 for book. Don`t I get 30 days free?  Can I talk to someone?  I am so disappointed.  Mel"
"1927","As I am still learning how to use my Kindle , I will not give it a 5 star until I know more about the device but other than that I really like this device ."
"1928","Smaller than my old Kindle. And the lending library comes with a monthly price tag. Better to use your public library online lending service, which is free."
"1929","I need more light to read this in my room so found it disappointing but easy to use. I do like that the battery hasn't needed to be charged in a long time!"
"1930","For some reason, the power button on this device randomly quits working, especially after sitting for a day or two.Other than that, it's nice."
"1931","I did expect the screen to be a little whiter (more like the color of newspaper), but I knew it wasn't the 'Paper White' so I am not too disappointed.Sensitive touch screen which is good, but if you have pets and get hair on the screen be careful not to wipe at it with a finger because it will change your page.was delivered very quickly."
"1932","Excellent Kindle. Compared to first generation Kindle paperwhite the screen is super sensitive. It is really enjoyable to use this. Unfortunately, I missed the light and decided to return it.I have given only 4 stars because previous generation kindles are lighter and sleeker than this. Although this has better specs, I feel there is no reason for this to be so heavy (but it is not a brick, just heavier than previous generation).Totally a good buy. But if you have used paperwhite before, you will miss the light ..."
"1933","hard to read,super touchy, not glare free. a disapointment"
"1934","Bought for my ten your old daughter who's a voracious reader. 200-300 page books in a couple of days if she likes them. Saving money now! Makes me very happy. Also picked up digital copy of Science News. The Science News needs a bit of tweaking to make the digital copy easier to read but the Kindle is a hit. Small, light and convenient with great wi-fi connectivity. At $59.00, it's almost disposable too. The ONLY problem I have experienced is it's so compact my daughter can sneak it to bed and stays up reading till God only knows! I am forced to do bed checks now for the Kindle. Note: My Kindle came set in Spanish. Fortunately I know some Tex-Mex so I was able to initially navigate through the menu options. I did however finally call the help center for Kindle and was promptly helped with the real ""Spanish"" menu options to change the default language to English. It was humorous too. A middle Asian helping a Tex-Mex speaking Caucasian with proper Spanish. We both laughed several times together and at each other too!"
"1935","I like it ok.  I gave my old one to my sister.  I like the buttons on the side better to turn the pages.  This one doesn't have buttons on the side.  Other than that though, I like it.  Finding the Home button is a little hard too.  Sometimes my finger are dry or something and I have a hard time getting the home button to work."
"1936","This kindle has the same great glare free feature of the former kindles with touchscreen capabilities. Touchscreen works well. No problems there. Overall, I love it. However,  unlike the older kindle versions, there is no external power source for an easy to carry lighted case which means I have not been able to find a case I like as well as the designs that fit with the previous kindles. I like to read before bed. The lack of backlighting is great for preventing eye strain, but zero visibility in the dark without at least a minimal light source. Any case has to have an external light for dark areas which gets a bit bulky to transport.So overall 5 for the kindle. Subtract 1 for having to use an external and usually bulky light source in the dark. Still love it in spite of that though."
"1937","Besides a pple devices,  amazon's kindle is also my favorite.  I had the first generation kindle.  Kindle paperwhite is much better than 1st gen.  I love it."
"1938","Great to read outside which is what I wanted.  Has taken two one hour sessions with Amazon trying to get it registered and be compatible with my kindle fire."
"1939","Perfect jobs! I have been using Kindle 4 with no touchscreen for 3 years and it's time to change. This device is a lot better than 4th version. Touchscreen make me easier read all my book especially when I want to go on dictionary or highlight any text. Love it!"
"1940","When I bought my first kindle, 7 years ago, it was always a significant savings to purchase the kindle edition vs the paperback (usually more than $6 cheaper to get the kindle version). I practically made back the money in my kindle investment with my savings. Now, I'm on my 3rd kindle and noticing that it's cheaper to buy most of the books in paperback than it is to buy the kindle editions. That is really frustrating, I have a new kindle (which btw is very touch sensitive and flips through pages if my kids touch it while I'm reading, or if I try to wipe a piece of dust off etc) and I'm annoyed at the price of the books (sometimes the savings is 15 cents or its actually more expensive than buying the paperback. LAME.  I give it a 3 star because I still love the convenience of having a new book at my fingertips in seconds, its a major space saver, and Amazon has pretty much wiped out all book stores, so even if I could get to the bookstore, it would take me 30 minutes to get there (and I live in Los Angeles).  So once again Amazon wins."
"1941","I'm one of those people who has waaaaayyyyy too many books. It's getting ridiculous trying to store them all. I have over 300 books! So, a Kindle makes sense! All future new books for me will be on the Kindle, either bought or borrowed from the local library. I love my Kindle! I don't need for it to do anything fancy. It does what I need it to do. All I had to do was go to the library, which offers free WiFi, and I was able to purchase and download a few books easily. Stores books. Keeps my place. And I can download again from the Cloud if something disappears. Light and easy to hold. Much easier than holding a big book. And I read some 900+ page books sometimes. I'm also finding that e-books may be cheaper than paper books. Saves trees too. I haven't had any problems. I will have to charge it more often than it says because I read so much. That's not a problem. I got my Kindle during Cyber Monday deals and got a great deal on it.I am always leery of technology but this is very user friendly. I would recommend this product."
"1942","Disappointed it did not have a back light.  Great gadget for reading in sunlight/beach.  Need to turn a light on for indoors, a liitle more often than for a book."
"1943","IT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, I PREFER MY OLDER ONE BUT THEN I WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND  TILL I GETTO SEE IF I GET ALL THE BOOKS I HAD ORDERED THAT WERE ON MY OLD ONE"
"1944","Got it as a birthday earler gift,With a but,when choosing a language got into the Chiness though I speak English (USA) & every time tried to change the setting it comes in away of cannot touch the setting to change languge ,Ilove having it .Light,dream comes true ,reach to my hand , wont work ."
"1945","it was a great purchase! totally worth the value. The only thing on design I think could be change is the possision of the botton. Just my opinion I think it will be more confortable on the top. but other than that it was a great purchase! Would buy it again and again. Battery do last for weeks!"
"1946","Nice little e reader, i should've paid more attention to item details and description though. No light and limited internet access, which is a task in itself to use."
"1947","Very disappointed. No audio feature. No whisper net. No control over ad content put on my kindle when it is asleep (As far as I know). I would return it if I could."
"1948","I bought that for my daughter first, but I did not like it. The screen looks pretty dark. I sent it back and got a paperwhite instead. It is worth the extra money."
"1949","For years I rejected the idea of an E-reader because I enjoy the feel of a book and the sound of pages turning but then my daughter bought me the Kindle as a gift and I have immensely enjoyed this experience.  I highly recommend the E-reader.  It is definitely more convenient than carrying a hardcover - my preference of book - or even a paperback."
"1950","While I've anticipated these things since the mid-1960s, I only bought my first one a couple of weeks ago.  My biggest complaint so far is there doesn't seem to be a Table of Contents.  That's always the first thing you come to in paper--and it's VERY helpful.  I am puzzled why it doesn't appear very first thing when you touch the title of an e-book.  The Shopping Cart had no listing for Religious.  I typed in ""Bibles""  and picked up a couple, but there should be a listing for them.  Maybe the Geeks and Literary Critics who design these things don't have much to do with religion, but here in the United States candidates for public office never bother attending an athiest convention and seldom bother with ones on philosophy or literature--but they ALWAYS make it a point to attend churches and make sure the cameras are rolling when they do.  They may not be terribly religious themselves--but they know an awful lot of people are and they DARE NOT neglect that group.  So neglecting them in your shopping cart is a bit of an oversight--don't you think?  Otherwise it's okay--except that for decades now pocket calculators have had solar cells, so how is it the e-book reader neglects them?  There is one thing I would find laughable about the Kindle if it were not so frustrating, and that is the QWERTY keyboard it displays:  One must hunt-and-peck all over the place to find the letters.  I suppose to an unthinking engineer a QWERTY like that used on computers would seem reasonable, but to anyone who understands how and why the QWERTY came to be it is rediculous.  Back when typewriters were first invented there were two basic philosophies on keyboards:  One was ABCDEFG while those familiar with the printing trade favored some form of ETAOIN SRDLU--the order of how frequently the latters were used.  The Problem was that the slow movement of the mechanical connections used on manual typewriters allowed the keys to jam up.  The QWERTY keyboard deliberately slowed down the typist's fingers so that the keys did not jam up.  Since the Kindle does not use jam-prone mechanically-linked arms and since QWERTY-trained human fingers do not rest on the keyboard it would make much more sence for the Kindle to use an ABCDEFG keyboard so that people will be able to find they keys they are looking for."
"1951","Love this new Kindle, still trying to figure some things out with it and the ""Cloud"" feature. Would highly recommend this product if you mainly read and don't need all the other ""bells and whistles"" with the other higher priced Kindles."
"1952","First off let me say that I love my new touch kindle...I had the old kindle that had the keyboard at the bottom and this is a huge improvement in my opinion! I love the fact that it is now touch-screen and that its at a low affordable cost! Glad I made this purchase."
"1953","I really liked this kindle the lay out is easy to navigate and fun to use. Though is glarefree it picks up a lot of light, I was disappointed to find that this kindle can't surf the web like my old kindle, the set in screen is not that big of a deal but dust does accumulate around the corners so I have to wipe down often. Other whys nice set up the touch screen is easy to use I've never had trouble with it. I'd say a worth the money."
"1954","As a new user of Kindle products, this basic edition will give me a chance to catch up with technology a bit.  It's easy to navigate and user friendly, with a screen that is very easy to read.  There are plenty of free books to download....this provides a nice way to learn all the features.  I am very pleased that I finally got a Kindle!!"
"1955","bought it on sale for $59 when they had a "" National Reading Month"" promotion (to replace my old 1st gen Nook simple touch), works great and i love it so far (kindle unlimited is definitely a plus!). Definitely recommend if you're looking for a basic e-reader :)"
"1956","Cons: No back light may be a deal breaker for people who read regularly. Most of the times it is fine but sometime I feel having a backlight will be good to have feature."
"1957","Love love love it!"
"1958","It's so great, I just don't know what to do with myself.*curls up in bed, is stormy out, begins to read*& so it was & is, many more times since."
"1959","I love it and it is my constant companion when it's not inappropriate."
"1960","No text to speech, even no speaker or earphone jacks.Bought some books (technical ones) in ""kindle"" format and later found out it doesn't work for Kindle Touch or Kindle Paperwhite. What?"
"1961","The screen is grey and too dark , and the brightness is not adjustable . I wish I had known this before ordering. I would order a paper white instead of a glare free."
"1962","I love my Kindle.  I have missed having one.  I use to have the Kindle Keyboard years ago.  I was hoping it would come back.  I could do so much with that.  My only problem with the touch screen is that if riding public transportation, going over a bump can sometimes change the page you're on and I find it difficult to get back to the page I was reading.  At home, or just relaxing, it's an A+ reading device.  I love my Kindle.  Thanks Amazon!"
"1963","Great device! I received this as a present and it is so easy to set up and use! Glare-free has met my expectations and I have read at a faster speed than usual, as it always returns to my last lecture. Purchasing menus are well organized and I am always receiving great deals; this results in an easier way to pick my next book."
"1964","Bought as a gift to replace her old kindle. She can't put it down. Loves the new touch screen and how much easier it has gotten to use. it is much lighter than the other kindle and has a better grip also. The screen is very easy to read and the fact that you can highlight and check online to see what a word means is great. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a e-reader."
"1965","It works great in daylight and if you have a lamp next to you if reading at night, but can't see to read in the car at night, haven't found a way to turn up the brightness."
"1966","Totally mediocre. Absurd that the brightness could not be adjusted. I rather thoroughly dislike and must exchange. Reading books on my iPad, iPhone and Nook is far superior"
"1967","The screen is smaller than I expected.  Having trouble navigating through pages.  Not as user friendly as I'd hoped.  Hopefully,  summer outdoor reading will be beneficial."
"1968","I liked my old kindle better. In order to shop the kindle store you have to be connected to wi-fi. On my old kindle I could buy books anywhere. It also feels cheaply made."
"1969","Doesn't read certain Kindle titles, such as the new xkcd book, so I returned it. It's a pretty good value for your money but you should probably get the new Fire instead."
"1970","When I pur phase this product I thought it was colored and not black and white....outside of that I have never been disappointed in anything I have purchased from Amazon."
"1971","Doesn't feel better in reading than my old Kindle 3, i.e Kindle keyboard. And what's with the ugly blocky design Amazon? I hate it. Could have been beautiful. For the price, the end user could have an option for audio jack. Even the 20 USD Nokia has it. The touch is not as responsive as it could, feels very tired when highlighting text.The interface could be better and contract also. For a kindle this price, the resolution could have been better too. The book title covers look so ugly. On the kindle 3, they looked amazing. Amazon could easily subsidize the cost of 'special offers' kindle even more, I am sure they tap into a lot of profit via these ads, this product is literally a handheld billboard with interactivity.Saying all that, its still better for readers who want focus then a shiny iPad."
"1972","Between my daughter and myself, we have purchased different kindles over the years. I wanted something for myself that I could read out in the sun. Which this kindle does. I am satisfied with it! The ads are a little annoying but I was aware of them when I bought this Kindle."
"1973","Had to call for help to do everything on it.  It came with no instructions and it was not like my first kindle.After several phone calls and several hours on the phone, I think I can manage it now.  Not that you are asking for my advice I  would like to suggest sending instructions with each new Kindle.  Your tech  team is very patient and helpful. they were very kind.  I spent about two hours with one on the phone, now if your tech team has a hard time trying to get it to work, just a imagine the average person working it  I probably would give a higher rating had I had directions and could have made it work.  I gave all your tech team excellent ratings which they deserved!"
"1974","Picture is great.  Easy to access and use all the apps I have downloaded.  Audio is also good.  Netflix is great and easy to download movies.  All apps transferred from old Kindle when I first turned it on."
"1975","This Kindle does everything it says it would. However, I didn't know how much I would need a backlight for reading at night. This feature isn't available on this model.  Also, I thought there would be a feature that would give a character description when the character name was highlighted, but this isn't possible either.  Other than these two disappointments, it is easy to read and accepts book downloads from Amazon quickly. Using wifi for anything else is pretty slow.  Battery life over 2 weeks is a plus."
"1976","I loved my old Kindle and love this one even more.  It is a nice size and can travel easily in my purse. I definitely would recommend this Kindle to anyone looking for a reader."
"1977","Love it. No backlight but I don't like feeling like I'm reading a computer screen, since I stare at one all day. This feels like I'm reading a book, just smaller and very light."
"1978","We bought this on a promotion and I knew that its features were limited, but it wasn't worth the money we spent. It definitely needs the backlight. Don't bother with this one."
"1979","I love my new kindle. I am enthusiastic with reading which something I wanted to develop as a hobby for a long time. And so far, I am very satisfied and happy with the kindle."
"1980","This is my third Kindle and, while it's taken me a bit of getting used to, I love it! So easy to get word definitions and the touch screen makes turning pages so much easier."
"1981","The Kindle screen is much much easier on the eyes due to its paper like feel. I use this for both pleasure and school, and I love how I can gave all of my books in one place."
"1982","Double outstanding.  I'm a ""Book guy"" who decided to try a Kindle.  Greatest thing since sliced bread.  Print is clear against the background.  Very easy to read and easy to navigate the Kindle.  Battery charge lasts a L=O=N-G time.  No problem here.  Recharging is easy - just plug in. Ordering books is a snap.  I cannot commend this Kindle highly enough for its wonderful technology.......and it's price.  The only advice I can give is.......get one.  You'll be glad you did."
"1983","I like it and have gotten used to how it navigates and like the fact there is no glare and it was easy to set up.  It initially connected to the internet but shortly after it will not.  I called my internet provider and it worked for a minute and then would not give me a secure connection to my wireless.  Frustrated, I will give it another shot at getting that corrected in a few days.  I do not find it all that easy to navigate finding a free Kindle e-book or even searching for an e-book to buy but I am new at this, so I will reserve my final opinion for later.  I have heard the same comments from other user friends as well.  All in all, I am glad I bought one."
"1984","I solved a mystery today--a small one but it was entertaining. I hadn't been thinking about it much, having only noticed it a few times before. But it's one of those things that, once you witness it actually happening in front of you, you become more aware of just how many times the thing happened before without your really having taken much notice of it (or, moreover, having any decent explanation of why it happened). My new kindle. I have left it outside before--whether on a table or in the grass I don't know and that doesn't matter--only to return and find that I hadn't read this page, or somehow the font size has changed, or something else is different. Aliens! No. I had it in the grass. Laying there, reading Feynman (of all things). An ant crawled up on it (they apparently appreciate Feynman also) and I watched in amazement, as the thing stepped over letters on the screen. The pages began to turn! The things carry just enough electricity (or whatever the mechanism) that a touchscreen will register their movement as user actions! In the spirit of Feynman, I proved that it's reproducible. (While they're more than willing to lose my page the moment I walk away, it took a frustratingly long time to get a damn one of them onto a blade of grass so I could place him onto the screen.)"
"1985","I had to get a new kindle when my old one died.  I thought this would be a better version but I was disappointed when I could no longer get games on this model.  Also since the page turner is on the screen instead of a separate button, sometimes the page turns before I am ready."
"1986","Can  anyone post a link to a cover/case for this Kindle with a built-in light? I bought one and was willing to pay $50 for it, but the Kindle is slightly too large for it. Thanks."
"1987","Love it, very light"
"1988","Good product but be aware that it doesn't have a light, so reading at night is not possible. It looks like the same item that does have a light so read the description carefully."
"1989","It won't download -freezes-may be defective-haven't been able to pursue tech helpAlso it' s near impossible to read graphic books on it-which are among my son's favorite books."
"1990","I like my kindle. Its the fist one I have owned. I did not know that I couldn't read it in the dark, so good lighting is necessary for good reading. Other than that, I really like my kindle."
"1991","I enjoyed the older edition until it had an electronic stroke and this forced me to purchase this new one.  At first I wanted to return it , however, the more I used it the better I like it.  Now I carry it and used it daily, I especially like it when I read out in sunlight. Hope this last as long as the old one. Also I was able to modify my cover for the older kindle which was longer to work perfectly with this new one."
"1992","My new kindle is not as user friendly as my olod one but I lost it---this one doesn't give me amt of pages left it is difficult to go to the dictionary--or manuver --page turn sometimes takes several attempts---wish I could find my other kindle"
"1993","I absolutely love my Kindle, within the first week of having it I read 3 books. As someone who suffers from migraines I love that you can change the font size and style and that the screen has the same texture of a paper page. The only complaint I have is that I'm so in love with I never do anything but read!"
"1994","This is my first Kindle. I immediately fell into love with it after I receive from the courier. It really reads like a book except for some flickering when the page view changes. I wish I could have spent another $40 more to get a Kindle Paperwhite. I should not be deprived of using such a great product in dim light =)"
"1995","This version of the Kindle is light, easy to hold, and easy to read. The features are intuitive and easy to master.  Although the device sometimes seems to get confused between going forward one page and going back one page (tapping the right versus left side of the screen). I wish it had the page turning visual of my previous Kindle, so I could be instantly aware when the page turned the wrong way. Other than that, for less than $100 US, I can carry hundreds of books with me every where I go. At this price I don't really even worry about dropping the device or having it stolen when I take it to the beach or the pool. As advertized, the battery does hold a charge for a very long time. I used it throughout 25 hours of flight and layover time and then read for almost a week before charging. This is the paperback Kindle; everything you need and not catastrophic if lost or damaged."
"1996","It is what I expected for the most part.  I did, however, expect to access my Nook library from my Kindle.  That was a disappointment that I can't have all of my books in one place."
"1997","Perfect affordable eReader. I prefer this over BN's Nook and Sony's eReader."
"1998","I like my 1st. Kindle better where it listed all my books plus those archived.  I also liked the screen size as I get older and need the print larger.  Over all I love my kindles."
"1999","I have poor vision and love how I can increase the font size. The lack of glare is also a big help. It holds a charge a long time and is very light. I definitely recommend this reader."
"2000","I love my Kindle.  I purposely got the one without any back lighting because I didn't want anything to interfere with my sleep cycle since they say blue light can have this effect.  I'm an avid reader and I love the fact that I can look up words immediately.  My two children are home schooled and we use lots of literature-based curriculums.  I plan to get them their own KIndle and buy the books online.  This is probably the best gift I ever bought for myself."
"2001","I really don't like this Kindle. The 'no-glare' is great, but I like my other Kindles better and wish I hadn't purchased it. Too bad my other Kindles don't come with the no glare screen."
"2002","I really dislike the advertisements that came built in. Every time I turn it on there is an ad. And they stay at the bottom when I go past the first page. I bought this for my daughter to read her books. Why in the world would I want advertisements on this paid device."
"2003","Really like it although I have hardly learned how to use it.  It fits into my purse so handily that I can take it anytime that I want.  It is smaller than I realized it would be, but 6"" is 6"" so I cannot complain.  In some ways, I would prefer the larger one, but this small one is handy and very readable."
"2004","This is my first review. This version of the Kindle is underwhelming. The gray-tinted background offers less contrast than previous versions, and thus requires more light to read without straining the eyes. I'm disappointed with my purchase and Amazon's decreasing standards."
"2005","Of course this is a perfect Kindle and you can use it for a clock and night light as well as a flashlight in the hostel when traveling. I love my Kindle and it was nice to share the love with my granddaughter."
"2006","The Kindle touch screen is a great reader.I have a Kindle Fire but I needed something to read with when I am outside.The Kindle Touch Screen can be read outside with no glare.I havent used it much yet but I think its a great reader especially for the price"
"2007","I didn't like how the screen resolution was so ancient looking. But I guess that whoever designed this product was going for an old school book look. Everything else was great though!"
"2008","I'm a Kindle fan. And this little device is always in my list of favorites. I know there are some other models with more features and perhaps better. But living in Venezuela is yeah... some kind of a nightmare. So this one is great and more than enough. The experience of the glare-free screen is really awesome. Responsive, quick, light and useful. Love my Kindle! :-)"
"2009","My only complaint is that there is no light for reading at night. Seems like an obvious inclusion... so I did not realize that this kindle did not have this feature before purchasing."
"2010","I liked that it seems like paper doesn't hurt my sight. . When I need to understand a word it's easy for me to check it out. . The only disadvantage is that there is no Arabic books"
"2011","This replaces my Kindle3 Keyboard edition that fritzed. I really like the touchscreen, and the ability to keep track of the words I look up. I had originally purchased the Kindle Fire to replace the old Kindle, but found I usually played games on it instead of reading. This new one encourages me to be less distracted. Really glad my wife gave this to me for Christmas :)"
"2012","purchase was in response to your website showing various kindle readers ....... purchased this as a gift ........ have reviewed the web pages a couple of times and I cannot see where the advertisement told me there would be no color on this reader ...... hence the disappointment for no color ....... I offered to return this device for one in color ........ recipient said this one is ok, can live with it ....... I, however, am disappointed"
"2013","Functionality is spot on for a ""refurbished"" unit. I upgraded from a gen. 2 so the additional features are really impressive. The two designations for storage, cloud vs. device, is a welcomed addition and the store ribbon at the bottom of the screen is nice but could possibly be annoying for some. The touchscreen locations for changing pages can sometimes make one-handed use a bit cumbersome but becomes easier with time. All in all a very well organized reader with great functionality and usability making it the best dedicated reader on the market."
"2014","Great"
"2015","Perfect for traveling. I got the good folks at my library to explain how to download their e-books and it's FABULOUS!Easy to use, easy to read, easy to get new books, way better than carrying the books I want to read in my suitcase! Why did I wait so long?"
"2016","The gadget is ok, but the pages often jump to some sections when touching the screen a little faster. The on/off power button sometimes is not working properly. When I turn off the button, it often still turns on so that it just instructs ""Swipe to unlock Kindle""."
"2017","It's a Kindle, what kind of review do you need. It's really, really great at one thing, and that's why you get it. Super long battery life even with heavy use, performs well in climates I'd consider ""extreme"" eg: Jungles during rainy season, and High altitude mountains during winter. Just pair it up with pelican style case, and you should be able to bring it everywhere, the low glare screen is what makes it superior to a tablet for reading, and that's probably the reason why you're considering getting one in the first place"
"2018","does all I expected of it and more. touchscreen is nice. password protection is great. light to carry and good battery life. the only minor drawback for me is a slow start and power off. easier to navigate than previous version"
"2019","Great"
"2020","great"
"2021","Nice."
"2022","Yes it is glaire free little too sensitive changes font sizes but just a slight touch which I have to keep on changing I'm not sure I would buy it again but all in all it's not a bad reader I bought it to read on the beach and seems to be fine like that I'm having trouble syncing it to my other devices"
"2023","Response time for all touch actions has a noticeable delay. Since it is a very basic display and graphics expected better response times.Other than that display resembles more like a book,  no backligting."
"2024","There was a bit of confusion about the kids bundle protection plan but once that was figured out it went smoothly. When you get the email about your promo code start with the protection plan listed on the Amazon site, not at the SquareTrade website. That is where the confusion came. The email I received made it sound like everything needed to be done with SquareTrade. I actually added the 2 year protection plan to my cart on Amazon and used the promo code there instead. Worked fine you just have to do each protection plan separately if you have purchased more than one Kindle. The kids are each going to love their Kindle! Excited for the birthdays to roll around in a few months!"
"2025","Great"
"2026","great"
"2027","great"
"2028","This is easy to use even for an older person who is not totally computer knowledgeable.  I did not think I would like it as I love books so much, however, it is so light and easy to use that I find myself enjoying it."
"2029","Great"
"2030","Sturdy yet lightweight construction. Ideal gift for seniors or handicapped individuals that find holding books to be difficult. Great ""hybrid"" for those less tech savvy.  Makes borrowing books from your local library a breeze!"
"2031","Happy"
"2032","great"
"2033","This is light and easy to fit in my purse... I can take it with me to read in the waiting room at the doctor or waiting in line at the post office, or any other time I get a minute. I love that I don't have to charge it often and it's easy to use. Great little reader!"
"2034","Great"
"2035","Great"
"2036","works"
"2037","great"
"2038","As an E-reader there was not anything wrong with this device.  I had had a Kindle Fire first and never was quite happy because I could do much more with the kindle fire so when it was reduced and I was able to return and order that I did.  It held a charge much longer then the Fire I had had did."
"2039","My eyes get tired really fast because of the display lights and this Kindle was perfect for me. I feel like I am reading on a paper. This is my first kindle and I totally recommend it. It is easy to use it and the touch screen is good. Be aware that this Kindle has no built-in light, so you can't read it on the dark."
"2040","I don't know why I didn't buy one of these sooner. The ads are very unobtrusive, but I love this Kindle already. Between its light weight and glare-free screen, I can read for much longer than I can on my tablet or my phone, which I'm thrilled with."
"2041","its not as great as a thought it was going to be because1- dosent support arabic book very good2- dosent have a head phone jack3- dosent have audible . idont know how a proudct by a company that dosent support it servicesbut never the less its a good device if you were into books you MUST buy the 7th gen kindleREVIEW BY : Abdullah albahouth @abdallalh187"
"2042","Good！"

"2044","great"
"2045","Its very user friendly...a great joy for book lovers like me... I prefer books to e-books..but kindle transforms e-books to normal books!! Its so easy to read... and does not strain my eyes!! Its like carrying my book collection around in my pocket!!"
"2046","I haven't had mine long yet -- still need to figure out the best way to navigate it. But I like the size and was particularly happy when it was easy to read outside in bright sunlight! I also have an older Kindle Fire which I am quite fond of, but decided to get an additional Kindle to function more as a book."
"2047","Returned it for the Paperwhite. It's nice but I have to have a built-in backlight for reading.  (Tip: if you have an IPhone, the plug-in charger part will work with the adapter, you do not have to buy it separately)"
"2048","I love my kindle!! It's amazing the antiglare and also the touch screen is enough for reading in less than a week I was able to read 4 books in a row!! I'm very happy with it. But I hope the Internet browser would work better."
"2049","As a reading tool, it's much lighter than holding a real book.  At my age, this is important because I am developing issues in my joints, particularly my left elbow, which cause pain when reading.  However, I purchased this for my sons to read and in less than 24 hours and before I was able to figure out how to set parental controls, one of my boys (both under 15) were able to download SAMPLE pornography.  I was not impressed to discover this filth is both so prevalent and so easy to obtain."

"2057","I really like my e-reader...so far I have read three books and still need to learn how to access books to put on it.  (Grandson set this up for me)  I still have a lot to learn about using it.  (I'm over seventy and way behind learning about this new ""fangled"" technology. Ha!)"
"2058","I have had a Kindle for some time and have been very happy with it, I just got a new one for Christmas. my only small problem with the old Kindle was the lack of a backlit screen. in bright light the old kindle screen is easier to see than the type of screen on a laptop or a tablet but in the dark you needed a reading light. The new Paperwhite solves this problem with a screen that is as visible in sunlight as the old one and has a variable backlight meaning I can read in bed without putting on my bedside lamp....a few points about Kindles in general, first they are better for books that you read through from beginning to end than for books that you leaf forwards and back in like reference books, second the browser is pretty useless for anything other than shopping for kindle books, if you want to browse the internet get a tablet if you want to read books get a kindle."
"2059","Great"
"2060","nice."
"2061","Handy size, easy reading Kindle 6"" Glare-Free is a great device for having reading material at hand. It is indeed an easy reading screen on which one can adjust text size, keep ones place bookmarked, and take a break from reading with the place you left off from immediately available upon return to the text. No backlight with this Kindle, but the screen is easy to read with a normal amount of light."
"2062","I just replaced my older Kindle (version 3 w/keyboard), and here are the pros/cons from that perspective:ProsThe touch screen is intuitive and makes navigating much easierthe contrast appears to be sharper and the image quality is betterit's smaller, but not too smallNot too bright so it doesn't hurt your eyes (always good with the basic Kindle models)ConsIt doesn't feel as well made. It has flimsier material that feels cheap and easily breakable. I understand that lighter is better but not if it results in a shorter product life.Slightly thickernot likely to last as long with all the screen touching, especially if it is e-ink.It is too small for a generation 3 cover (to be expected, but now I have to make some alterations to my leather case)If you are looking for something simple that you don't care about kicking around, this works. I am a little bummed at this new Kindle. It's not as solid as the older ones, but it's not awful.*Also, I went from no ads to ads because I thought I wouldn't mind and well, I do. That's my own fault though. If anyone out there is thinking about going with the special offers and has been without it, know this: Besides the screensaver, the ads are a bottom banner even on your home page."
"2063","Like the screen, a bit too much tech stuff for this senior to absorb i.e. page numbers, timing how fast you read, etc., a bit much for this senior reader.Still not sure how I get the book to the cloud when I am finished with it. Disappointed that when I asked to remove the promotional items I had to pay over $20 for that to happen. As an octogenarian I'm pretty much aware of what I like to read so reading suggestions are not appreciated and certainly not needed yet I had to pay to have them disappear. Bad policy!!The cord could have been a bit longer when charging the book. The help I received from Gavin and a woman I spoke to the day before I spoke to Gavin were helpful and very patient with this senior's concerns."
"2064","Great"
"2065","Great"
"2066","Cool."
"2067","great"
"2068","Amazing!! Feels like reading a paper book. I'm not much of a reader so I ordered this model but now I can't put it down and have been reading nonstop! Makes me wish I ordered the backlight model now heh. You will not be disappointed.."
"2069","This is my first ""real"" kindle, previously I was using a first Gen kindle fire. I recieved this as a Christmas present and have been using it a lot since receiving it. I have noticed a significant reduction in eye strain and the reading experience, so far, has been great. It is like reading newspaper print. My version has the advertisements, and I have to say they don't bother me at all, which is something I was worried about (they are nonexistent when reading). I haven't experienced any cons. It is a great lightweight little kindle and I like that it doesn't have back lights (it makes the experience much closer to reading print)."
"2070","A great new design, this basic Kindle is actually far from basic.  It is super light (so much easier than trying to read from my iPad!) and can be held and operated (pages turned) in one hand.  A total win."
"2071","Works great, exactly as advertised. Wish I had sprung for one of the 3g kindles, but that's on me. I switched from using the kindle app on my iPad Air 2 to using this because of readability."
"2072","I like the product, but just wish it were better in 'no so optimal' lighting.  I find it can be difficult to read if the room is not very well lit.  Otherwise, I love it. Super easy to use"
"2073","Fantastic way to read!  I don't like using a tablet as reader because of the LCD screen and backlight that cause eyestrain and effects sleep.  But the kindle makes easy and friendly to read a book in bed or at any time."
"2074","I received this Kindle as a gift from my husband and I absolutely love it! I can't believe it's taken me so long to join the Kindle family. It's truly lightweight and easy enough to carry around in a bag. I love that the screen is glare-free and that it's soft on the eyes. This is great for someone who works a long day in the office (especially if you're staring into the computer screen all day) and wants to unwind with a book in the evening. Paper books are great too but this beats it by a mile with its slim design and feather-weight touch!"
"2075","I never write reviews, but I'm so happy with my Kindle that it definitely deserves one.I resisted buying a Kindle for years, partly because I prefer reading books the ""old-fashioned way"" and partly because I just enjoy collecting books (especially attractive hardcover editions or out of print/antique books.) Recently, I got a Kindle as a birthday present for my boyfriend - he loved it, and I saw first-hand why. Since getting one for myself, I too have been loving it: it's *perfectly* suited for light reading, or reading in bed! I love that I can get all those novels, ""guilty"" reads and general history books I don't necessary want to burden my bookshelves with at a lower price - I save room, and apparently, I also gobble them up at half the speed and wrist pain (when reading in a reclined position.)So, if you're an avid reader and/or you love the real thing, but would rather stop hoarding paperbacks you end up selling at garage sales a year later (while saving up for beautiful editions of things you want to hold on to for life), invest in a Kindle. Couldn't recommend it more!"
"2076","what I am frustrated is the warranty setup. I have spent several hours to activate the warranty, with many calls to Squaretrade. They have no  understanding of how it work and online registration for warranty should not that difficult.  If amazon giving coupond why it should not automatically ask squaretrade setup the warranty. Why sending an email with additional discount code to me and make me go through this headache. Totally unhappy with Amazon on this."
"2077","I was told it was a paper white so ordered a leather cover for it...obviously the expensive cover does not fit.  The box the Kindle came in had no model number or name.  It was a Christmas gift."
"2078","The body of this Kindle when I compare it to some older generations is from a cheap material. Also, the touch screen was not sensitive enough at least to my fingers (my fingers are kind of dry)."
"2079","nice and light but I wish it cane with a lighted cover.bought a great cover but due to the smooth back there is nothing to power the light.Kindle replaced my old keyboard one that finally died."
"2080","It is very good, I just don't like anything Touch Screen and I haven't figured out how to make the print bigger. I think it is on the smallest possible print but that is my eyes not the Kindle."
"2081","Good unit, but I wish there was a way to turn pages without touch screen (maybe a side button as an option) as sometimes when I am reading, I inadvertently touch the screen and turn the page."
"2082","Since this device is usable ONLY with ambient light, if you are searching for anything else, don't buy it.  Save yourself time and money.  When the display arrived, I quickly discovered the only way to increase screen intensity was with an outside light source.  Unlike the far superior product, the Paperwhite, this device only provides portrait display--no landscape.  So, if you are sitting in the sun all day and want something to read on, I suppose this is the product for you.  Otherwise, spend the extra bucks for the Paperwhite.  PS  If you do return it, be sure to check Doesn't Work.  Otherwise Amazon charges you $2.98 for return postage,.  Not a great charge, but still, for a product unusable except in the most limited circumstances?"
"2083","I've had a second-generation kindle for years and enjoyed it, but the touch screen makes for a much smoother reading experience. I find myself more willing to switch between books and search within a book because the navigation is easier and the rate at which the pages load is quicker. I bought the version with ads, and the ads aren't distracting at all. I'm actually glad I didn't spend the extra money for no ads. I use a case, so I don't really see what's on the screen when I'm not reading anyway."
"2084","Worth It.This was 100% worth purchasing and I have no regrets about my choice of model. The ads are really not a big deal at all and it saved me a lot of money to go with this version. I've already recommended this to a couple of friends, as I've been very happy with this purchase."
"2085","The screen is not Illuminated.  I must have room light.  I cannot use it in bed with no lights on.  I especially cannot reverse the Illumination, white letters on black.  BIG LOSS FROM EARLIER MODEL."
"2086","The Kindle charged up for first time use faster than I anticipated. It's great! I love carrying this rather than a book. Won't give up books butthe Kindle is more convenient and portable for me sometimes. Packaging was hassle free, instructions clear.......all positive"
"2087","I love it. It feels like a book. The only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't change brightness. So you have to read it with light. It also seems like it is never off, because of all the ads."
"2088","I received this as a gift for Christmas and am returning it because of the following:I do not like the gray background with the black letters. Too difficult to read even when making the characters bigger.I do not like seeing ads every time I leave my page and come back on.I will be getting a paperwhite."
"2089","When I ordered this I was really excited.  When I received it I realized I didn't read all the details and missed the part that said there is no back lighting. However I bought on clip on light for $1.60 and it has worked well.  My granddaughter borrowed the Kindle and is having a wonderful time reading all kinds of books.  I have Amazon Prime and she can get all kinds of books for free.  A great buy on my part and I love it."
"2090","Very light so easy to carry in my purse so I always have reading material available.  Downloads are easy and fast.The anti glare makes it a bit darker inside tham I like.  Butonce I read the manual I'll probably find there's  a setting to adjust it."
"2091","I absolutely love my new Kindle.  I had a Kindle Keyboard until it broke and was finally able to get myself a new glare-free Kindle.  I prefer this one over the Keyboard.  It's easy to use and you can either swipe or just touch the side to turn the page.  It's very light and compact, so easy to take along with me in my purse wherever I go.  Very happy with my new purchase."
"2092","I bought the Gen 6 to replace an older Kindle that had started having problems. I love how easy it is to turn a page. The longer battery life was a big selling point for me. I only have 3 stars because of the lack of audio component. I love to. Listen to my books when I'm on the go and for the blind I know that was a great feature. I don't need it lighter nor do I want to spend a small fortune on a Kindle Fire to get what should be a standard feature. I would have given the Gen 6 five stars if they had not removed it."
"2093","I bought it on Nov 27, 2015 to give as a gift for my sister in law. She started using it in January, and by the 2nd week of February, the screen already stopped working. At first it was intermittent -- stop and go -- then it just completely stopped working. No wonder the warranty is only up to January 31st. I guess they knew it would stop working after only a few weeks."
"2094","Overall the Kindle platform is excellent for reading both articles and books. The e-ink display is adequate for reading in daylight, however if you plan to read in the dark it is hopeless due to no back-light. On the subsidized version with ads, it can e somewhat annoying due to a very small variety of ads and thus repetitiveness. I enjoyed the integration with Goodreads. Compared to competitors like the nook, the kindle has a huge advantage in terms of selection and also price. I recommend this device to anyone who loves reading and wants a device that can store all their books in one place."
"2095","Really good investment."
"2096","My students love these!"
"2097","should include a hard copy users' manual! Not clear how to get it started; started a free trial on a newspaper and can't figure out how to get today's edition onto the kindle; will probably now sign up to get the paper on the kindle; can get a digital version for same price on email link to my PC."
"2098","Am having fun with it!"
"2099","9/10th of the way reading a book and the reader freezes. Attempted to rest  the reader..everything... I may have it working again, don't know if it was the book???or the reader, frooze on page 312. I have deleted the book... Maybe i will check it oout from he library so I can finishe reading it. lol"
"2100","6"" E-ink (with page buttons on the side) seems to have died in approximately a year. 'Worked well & satisfied until then. It raises 2 questions: 1) why buy the same brand/company that had such a short life? 2) is this what can be expected w/ the more costly units? If so, it makes me re-think if a dedicated e-reader is for me at all - as opposed to a tablet or other option. Seeing the new units are tough-screen only does not encourage buying another."
"2101","I love having a way to take my current book with me without carrying it everywhere.  I'm not experienced enough to use it by myself, but am almost there.  The library has been my source, since I am technologically impaired.  I haven't been able to shift it to the chapter I'm on, since I'm reading from the hard copy at home.  There may be a way.  I'm a hands on person so I avoid printed directions.  That's strange, considering that I am never without a book since I've been in the second grade.  I am 68, so u can see the reason that it is an adjustment for me to have something other than a book itself in my hands.  I really wanted the Kindle for trips."
"2102","I have to have a non-blue screen reader to read before bed so when my original Kindle broke I bought the more expensive Kindle. I thought it would be most like my first Kindle, but it was not. I do not like the touch screen set up. I can't go back when reading newspaper articles (to the previous article, not to the previous page) and my hand often hits something it's not supposed to and then the thing jumps around and it's harder to shop for new books. So I returned the expensive Kindle and got this one and the experience is almost identical.  Might as well pay less money."
"2103","Got the Kindle free after rebate when bought a laptop from staples. Battery has good charge and I like the amount of free or cheap books on Amazon. Got Grisham book on sale at Thanksgiving but is was a disappointment but the Kindle is not."
"2104","great."
"2105","I am looking to get an e-reader but want a screen a little larger than 6"".  Maybe 8"" or so.  For me the kindle screen is a little too small.  Don't want the fire because of the shorter battery time.  Besides, I already have a tablet so don't need that other stuff the fire can do.  Just want a simple e-reader that I can use to read books, just that."
"2106","Works great! I love it!!"
"2107","I have owned the original Kindle key board and purchased the Kindle Fire 7 inch as an upgrade. However I just wanted a dedicated reader that didn't have a keyboard (which was time consuming) so when the new Kindle Touch 6 inch 4G came out, I had to jump on it. You can read in direct sunlight  and the screen remains glare free, no eye strain. The pages turn effortlessly and you can adjust the font as you read so no need for readers. It's small and compact , fits easily in your purse or in a wide jacket pocket. Holds hundred of books and can download a book in seconds. It does not light up, which isn't a problem because you can purchase a light to attach when needed or purchase a case with a built in light. With the new Kindles you will get the advertisements as your screen saver. The older Kindles had a few portrait options for a screen saver. The battery life is exceptional, you can read for hours everyday without charging. It does not come with a wall charger, the previous model had the wall charger included. The Kindle Library is extensive with hundreds if not thousands of free books to chose from. Kindle Touch has a special feature were more then one person can use the reader. For example when one person sign in it will show that person there personal library and vice versa for other readers. I paid $59.99 on sale during the holidays, I would have paid the regular price of $79.99 because it is well worth it and this Kindle will not let you down."
"2108","I never thought I wanted an e-reader, but was given this as a Chrstmas gift. I was suprised how much I enjoyed reading on it. The glare-free screen was easy to read with no eye strain, like I feel when being on a computer screen an extended period of time. It is light weight and easy to hold while reading. No fighting to hold some pages open like while reading. May have liked a light so I could read in bed without disturbing my husband, but would not give up the Glare-Free screen for a back light."
"2109","Had the old Kindle and this pretty much made an improvement since it's faster, smoother and easier to operate. Typing in this couldn't be easier and would totally recommend to people who would want to upgrade their old Kindles or someone who wants to buy it for the first time."
"2110","I don/t really like this Kindle - am used to the one with keyboard.  Had a hard time finding books I have ordered and can't figure out  how to ""archive"" the ones I have read.  Very disappointed in this device.."
"2111","great little kindle. I have a Fire, a Paperwhite (my absolute favorite) and this one I keep in my purse I love it, it's small and lightweight.  No backlight but it's perfect for what I am using it for"
"2112","Overall it is very nice and extremely light weight, but trying to bring up the menu tool bar to access settings isn't not too easy, since you have to press and hold the very top edge of the device and wait for it open, gets frustrating when it thinks you are highlighting a word or phrase, they should have given it a dedicated ""Home"" button that would take you to the menu bar, or the home screen, if you have big hands it is almost impossible to open up the menu bar to access settings."

"2119","Thanks to all the informative reviewers who go into such great detail, and really help folks to make informed decisions about buying a new Kindle.  I have a question for folks who have one of the newer Kindles (either the 'plain' ""6 inch touchscreen display--the $79 model, or the newest Paperwhite). One of the things I loved about my plain old kindle (the older one without keyboard, with built in light) was the ability to read WITHOUT being online, in ""airplane mode"".  So no annoying pop up features and such interrupting my reading.  I know Amazon proudly touts all the fabulous things the latest and greatest Kindles do with wifi, but unless I'm downloading a book, wanting to look up a word, etc., I really don't want to be online.  Can anyone tell me if the newest plain Kindle and the Paperwhite both (or either) have ability to turn off wifi for reading a book that has been downloaded??? Thanks for any info--"
"2120","I purchased this at the urging of my sister-in-law who is much more tech savvy that I am. We are going on a lengthy vacation later this year and I did not want to have to lug around a huge bag of books on our trip. This device was on sale but I delayed purchasing it and when I went to order it was back to its original price of $79.00. I still think it was a good deal for me because I have already read 2 books and I've been able to carry it in my purse when I want to take a book with me to an appointment. It is lightweight  and relatively compact. An English teacher at heart, I DO prefer a 'real' book but the ease of the Kindle is great in certain circumstances."
"2121","Fabulous! Love the e-ink. The e-ink has always been my preference for my kindle since I live in Florida and do a lot of reading on the beach. Very pleased with my purchase. I love kindles... So convenient to have several books on one small device."
"2122","I love"
"2123","Great!"
"2124","A plus"
"2125","Woohoo"
"2126","goood."
"2127","Light, and compact enough to go into any midsized handbag. It's perfect if all you need is books to read without the hassle of their weights. Just remember that if you don't entirely shut it down, it does slowly drain the battery, but since all the functions it has is that of a e-reader, the battery does last very long.If you need more functions like that of a tablet, then I'd recommend to skip this and the Fire and go straight for a tablet/iPad instead."
"2128","Did not expect to like it as much as I do - but the reduction in eyestrain is pretty amazing. Just getting acquainted with the world of Kindle-formatted books is introducing me to some fun new authors. I've resisted e-books, but am definitely enjoying them now."
"2129","This is an amazing value IMO. But I bought it for one purpose, to use it with my dji drone as a video monitor. Kindle is an amazon product, so it doesn't come set up to use google apps. I knew this, and had planned to try hacking google play on to it, since amazon sells dji drones and amazon fire tablets, it only seemed right. It worked after much brain strain and trying to download things that the fire said I couldn't download because my device wasn't configured to download this kind of stuff. I am very happy with it, and may even try a game or two, but I don't think so. Buy it, you can't go wrong."
"2130","The background seems a bit dull compared to ""normal"" books. Otherwise, it is very good at doing what it says, that is being a book reader. I have already loaded my books and have started reading on it."
"2131","Love my kindle! Bought this one for my 9 year old daughter. It encourages reading. Kindle is easy to use. I was afraid it would take me a long time to master. Took me about 5 days. It took my 9 year old less than 1 hour!!! It is also convenient to buy or borrow a book and read it immediately. I will not buy certain types of books at the book store, but will buy and read the same in my kindle. Kindle is a great machine!!!!"
"2132","Great!"
"2133","I love"
"2134","Great!"
"2135","Great!"
"2136","lovely"
"2137","I received this Kindle for Christmas.  Was not expecting what I received.  This Kindle is amazing.  Cannot get over how it can show so many books and you can read Samples of whatever book you are deciding to read.  The Flashcards are great, for increasing your vocabulary.  The battery life is long, and the Kindle is so portable you can take it with you wherever you go and you have reading material available.  There is so much more to learn to do with this little gadget.  What a fabulous gift to give to anyone; I had no idea how nice this thing is!  Love it!"
"2138","Useful"
"2139","Love the unit, but the programming still doesn't provide a way to keep the books in collections from being listed on the main screen.  Since I have over 590 books current, it makes it time consuming to find the book I want to read without going through many steps to find the one I want.  I appreciated the old system where I could store collections as I chose and have a smaller list to contend with!"
"2140","Clean-looking, easy interface, no more need to attach to a computer, a lot of good books available without additional cost because of my Prime membership, and a beautiful screen. Everything I want an e-reader to be, nothing I don't."
"2141","This is the second Kindle product I have owned. Purchased it primarily to use as a reader because of the ability to use it in brighter light. So far it seems to be a good choice even though it is not as easy to use as the other Kindle I own. Hopefully in time I will understand it better. The help provided by Amazon has been great so I think it will get easier as I learn more about it. I really like the light weight of the unit. Makes it more like holding a paperback book than the larger/heavier Kindle I own. Plus, it is easier to take with me when I am going somewhere where I might want to use it. I've only had it for a couple of weeks so I don't know how it will be long term but right now I am very pleased with my purchase."
"2142","Thought I would never enjoy using a Kindle for reading but this is GREAT. Fits easily in my purse so I always have something to read. I am on a fixed income so I especially love being able to download books from the library. Why did I wait so long to get this?"
"2143","It gets glare, you can't adjust the brightness (if you can it's very hard to find), lots of books are $10 . But otherwise it's great and I love it, much easier on your eyes and very convenient. I love the pictures it shows when you turn it off and it has great battery!"
"2144","This was my first Kindle and I love it...enough said. With the Prime membership its even better to borrow books for free. The battery life is great, it's light weight and very easy to use.( I wish I could have been paid to say that.)"
"2145","Love this already! I am using it for passing the time while commuting to work. It's small, light, easy to use. Either you can't adjust the screen brightness, or I'm dumb and can't figure out how. But I have to have lights on when reading to see the screen."
"2146","It's very light and easy to read using one hand, which is good. My big disappointment is that the screen is not nearly as good as I expected. Beyond the fact that you can't use it at night, even during the day the screen seems unusally dark at times and in places, and is not easay to read. Perhaps I'm missing something as to how to manipulate the visitbility of the screen, but if not, this is a drawback in my view."
"2147","The Kindle 6"" Glare-Free is nice. However, my previous Kindles had text to speech. That I miss."
"2148","I really like it. I researched it and knew what to expect as far as features. The ""offers"" are really unobtrusive. I think next time I will upgrade to one with a built in light. With the whispersync I just read on my cell phone in the dark and use my kindle for daytime reading. It does feel fragile and with two young children in the house I feel like I have to hide it. The official Amazon cover would be nice but seems expensive in comparison to the price of the actual device."
"2149","👍👍👍"
"2150","I love it.  It was a surprise Christmas gift.  My old Kindle was great but it has been having charging problems and I cannot read Kindle on my I pad when I am in the sun.  I really like that I don't have to press a button or swipe to turn a page."
"2151","Until this new Kindle Touchscreen, I have always given 5 star ratings to the three (Yes, three, this is not my first Kindle e-reader rodeo and I found some of the reviews I read to be quite condescending!) previous Kindle e-readers I have owned. I have been extremely frustrated with the sensitivity of the screen when touching it to turn the page and with the constant and truly annoying changing of the font due to, it seems to me, just breathing a little too hard. I generously give this one three stars. Amazon, please consider adding a lock to keep the font from changing so randomly and frequently. One reviewer stated that he/she had to change the font 100 times in two days of ownership. I find it necessary to change mine 100 times in an evening of relaxing and reading before bedtime! Something also needs to be done to correct the sensitivity of the screen when turning pages."
"2152","I have seen the Kindle before but never bought one. I had received the one I have as a gift. I just love it. Easy to download new books it's light and so easy to get comfortable in any position to read it. I definitely would recommend this."
"2153","Now in it's seventh iteration, the Kindle still reigns supreme as the e-book reader of choice for millions of users. It is easy to see why. The e-ink display is easier on the eyes than backlit LCD panels and works without glare or reflection in direct sunlight. Downloading books is simplicity itself - just a single click on the responsive touch screen. It's small size and light weight make it a pleasure to read wherever you go.As an Amazon Prime member, the functionality of the entry-level Kindle is fortified well beyond it's low price point with tens of thousands of books in the Kindle Owner's Lending Library that can be borrowed free of charge each month. Add a Kindle Unlimited subscription, and you have access to more books than you could ever imagine!"
"2154","I originally purchased a Kindle Fire 7"" tablet, thinking I could use it to read.  I didn't do my homework as it is no good for reading outside.  This is just what I needed--it carries easily and is perfect for reading outside."
"2155","I had (and still have) a first generation kindle. I prefer a non-backlit screen. It's easy on my eyes since I have to be in a well lit area to read. The battery life has been excellent. I've had it about a month and I still have 40% battery left. Granted, I haven't been reading a ton but, the battery life over the first generation is astounding. This is a great simple kindle which is what I really wanted. And it's so light! I can hold this and read comfortably for hours. Books also download onto my kindle super fast. What can I say, I love kindles and this one is a great kindle for the price."
"2156","Love how lightweight it is!"
"2157","I am not happy with this reader.  I should have researched better, but thought I could read at night but can't without a light on.  The dicrispiton said no glare can read in any light.  It was my error to not search further.  I didn't start using my reader till after 30 days so couldn't send it back.  I don't use it very often."
"2158","It's perfect! Been using it every night now, and I started reading again. It is so light, compact, and easy on the eyes...really it feels just like  a book. Unlike a paperback, you can put it down and read without using your hand to hold the pages. It does process faster compared to an older Kindle. Battery life is amazing. The *only* thing I would change is to have a backlight on this, but not having a backlight makes it feel more like a real book, so that's okay!"
"2159","Love the kindle! Received this as a gift and was slightly hesitant to start reading on an e-reader but after spending time reading on the kindle it was a very quick adjustment and I don't even notice anymore. I would recommend this to any avid reader as it is extremely convenient to purchase books (they download in an instant!) and it will also eliminate clutter in the household (so slim you can bring it everywhere). Great gift and I would recommend this product!"
"2160","Overall I like it.  It's not, for me, as easy to navigate as my 2nd generation Kindle but I'm sure I'll get used to it.  Also, there are advertisements on it which I hate.  But the size is good, and reading on it is pretty nice."
"2161","I love being able to sit outside again and read. I also love that it's easier on the eyes than a tablet. There is no glare, so there is no eyestrain. On the down side the cord is way too short. Also, while Amazon says it holds a charge for weeks but with the way I read I have to charge it every three days."
"2162","Perfect"
"2163","Love it"
"2164","Love it"
"2165","I am still trying to figure out how to bookmark on my new Kindle. However, I did mange to find my opened book after I closed my kindle for the night.  Now I also have to learn how to put a book, when finished reading it, into the cloud.  Lots to learn.  So for now, I give my new Kindle a 2 star rating.  Actually, my old Kindle is much better."
"2166","This device more than met my expectations. My old Kindle froze on me and I couldn't unfreeze it, and this one is a perfect replacement. I take it with me everywhere now to read my books. I love it and would buy another one when I wear this one out."
"2167","I LOVE this kindle, because my son never wants to play on it because it can't download games! I love the ability to have any books at my finger tips! The ONLY thing I do not like is it not having a light, so I cant read in the dark."
"2168","Amazing"

"2172","I'm still getting used to this product, going from a full kindle with the full internet and everything else with it is a big change, since having a warranty won't cover the cracked screen from a crazy person throwing it and breaking it. This is going to take some getting used to but I definitely like this product and it's a good replacement."
"2173","I am enjoying my Kindle. It has its advantages. No more piles of books everywhere.I wish there was a light I could switch on.Some of the fonts are unreadable because they are so faint and grayed out.It would be nice if I could deepen the font color where that is happening.I must say there is something really special about having a good book in my hands that I can skim through.Probably why I never got a Kindle until now."
"2174","The only downside I have found for this particular Kindle is that there isn't a large selection of cases available yet.  Very few of them have lights, however, IMO it's the best Kindle for the money if you are just looking for an e-reader."
"2175","I bought it for my son (6 yr old). It has so many famous book series and he is loving reading on Kindle. Easy to setup and understand for kids 4 yrs and up. The screen is glare free (like a paper), navigation is easy and touch is super smooth. It is also a great device for grown ups."

"2181","The Kindle, 6"" Glare-free Touchscreen display meets my requirements. It replaces my original Kindle with buttons. The size is comfortable and easy to hold with one hand. The screen is very visible even in bright sun. The touchscreen can sometimes be annoying. You have to be careful holding the device, not to inadvertently touch the screen accidently changing the page, sometimes forward, sometimes backwards. I would recommend this device to a friend."
"2182","I loved the pre-registration graphics, after registration the graphics are now ads.  Tried to turn them off and get back the artwork.  I haven't succeeded yet.  Love the Kindle. I love the books available too. Lots of books I've got to read now. Don't always love WiFi.  Nice weight and not cumbersome to hold.  Easy to use.  Very happy, except for missing the cool graphics.  If I can figure out how to turn the artwork graphics back on I'll be over the top happy.  Very nice product."
"2183","I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my aunt, after her old one has worn out. She loves this new one. She was so pleased to receive it and has really enjoyed getting to use it. She was quite upset when her old kindle, one of the first ones to come out, wore out. This one is has more features than the old one, though I can't speak for them personally as it wasn't purchased for my self. But I can definitely say she was not disappointed with it."
"2184","Really wanted the paperehite with its light and increased DPI, but convenience store at the hospital had these on sale for $58, no tax. There kids have one each. Is surprised how easily I fell into reading with this device. I've gone from  reading none  to three books weekly. With whisper-sync, I can listen to a book in the car with audible on my phone then pick up right on this device where voice stopped."
"2185","Love it"
"2186","Awesome"

"2188","The kindle surpassed my expectations. This is my first E-reader, I am amazed at how much it resembles the printed page. It is so much easier to read on than a tablet. The availability of Overdrive books is huge bonus for me. I am incredibly happy with my kindle!"
"2189","I need to upgrade my old Kindle but do not want to give up text to speech feature which I love when driving.  Will this ever return to the Kindle, I bought a Fire but just can't read it sitting in the sun and it's a pain having to carry 2 with me and sync the books I am reading.  3 stars only beause I miss this feature!"
"2190","Love this Kindle actually better then my Fire HDX to read outdoors. The no glare on the pages is amazing. I highly recommend this Kindle if you like reading while you are outdoors. Thanks once again Amazon."
"2191","I have been a kindle owner for over 3 years now.  I have been extremely happy with my first kindle.  You see, I am an amputee.  I lost my right arm in a car accident.  I am also a person who uses a bus to commute each day to my job in Seattle.  So receiving my first kindle as a gift from my sister was a big advantage because of the awkward struggle it is to try and read a paperback or hardbound book with only one hand.Recently, something happened and about 80% of my screen stopped working and the display has a random collection of pixels showing that never change.  I contacted Amazon and reported the problem.  You promptly sent me, and charged me for, a replacement kindle.Well, I have to tell you that I am very frustrated.  My former kindle was a kindle keyboard.  What was most advantageous was the buttons on each side of the device that would page forward or page back.  The buttons being on each side meant that you could easily use it with one hand, whether it be the left hand or the right hand.I realize that having only one hand puts me in a small group of your customer base.  I further realize that having only a left hand is further minimizing my needs into a smaller demographic of e-book readers, but here are my observations:• The black portion of the device that constitutes the frame can easily be held from the back, but then I cannot reach the screen for the required finger swipe.• I can “pinch” the black case between my thumb and fingers, but that leaves my thumb as the only finger that can “swipe” or “tap” at the screen to change the page.• Releasing the device to change the page makes the device “balanced” on my remaining fingers, so I am anticipating that this device will end up being dropped to the floor much more frequently than my former (and much more useful) kindle device.I do understand the futility in hoping for a “de-evolution” of your kindle line, and I am not ignorant of how few “lefty’s” there are in your customer base.  I just needed to clarify why I will be looking across the market of readers to see if there is a better device to meet my particular needs.  I do want you to know that if this situation did not exist, I would remain a satisfied kindle customer and user."
"2192","Love :)"
"2193","So the product was great...until there was a tiny scratch that poured bright light. This light made it hard to read and focus on anything but the scratch. I thought customer service would help out like they have before but that was not the case. Be warned Amazon does not perform any repairs. This small scratch will cost me a brand new kindle...which I am not likely to buy because I do not want to feed into the cycle. The customer support used to be great but policies must have changed recently because the customer support was terrible. That the only option is to buy a brand new kindle or sucks it up."
"2194","I have been reading Kindle books for years on laptops, and I tried a tablet and my phone for a while, too.  I needed something to read before bed, and I learned that this regular Kindle without a light is the healthiest option.  It has a great touch screen and it is very comfortable and lightweight.  I think this is a much better option for reading books.  It's also free from apps, texts, and other distractions.  I recommend it."
"2195","The Kindle is fine, But it's the Kindle unlimited that's misleading at best.  When you say unlimited, I read that as being open to anything out there, which this program is not. Seems like you pay the money up front and the selection is older than books at my local library. Sure wish they could have made it truly unlimited as it was advertised........................."
"2196","I purchased my new kindle on prime day after my 2nd generation kindle bit the dust after getting squished on a road trip (RIP dear Kindle friend) I was insistent on not getting a ""Light Up"" or back lit version because the whole reason I love the kindle is the real ""pages"" look the the e-ink provides. After receiving my new kindle and setting it all up, I am thrilled with it!! I hope that the touch screen doesn't lose its calibration, but other that that I don't see any reason I won't love my kindle for years to come the way I did my old one."
"2197","My wife gave this to me as a Christmas gift, and it is so enjoyable. The interface is very easy to set up and use right out of the box.  This is my first e-reader, and the e-ink display is very easy on the eyes compared to a LCD screen, and the battery life is amazing.  My first use constituted twenty-three (23) days of reading (averaging 45 minutes per day) following a full charge using a micro-USB port.  It's definitely something I would recommend to others, and it lives up to the technical specifications detailed on Amazon's website.  Great product!"
"2198","I bought this on sale for $49.  I wish I had bought two.  I already have a Kindle touch so I am familiar with how this one works.  This kindle is much faster than the touch in that it connects to Amazon almost instantly.  The controls like home command are all on top of the screen.  The battery does seem to work longer, but I have not owned it for enough time to truly test this.  This Kindle works well and the operation is smooth."
"2199","Thanks!"
"2200","Love it"
"2201","Kindle is a good e-reader with a touchscreen display that reads like a real paper with no screen glare, even in bright sunlight. It is light weight and has excellent battery life. One of my observation is that there is a very slight delay for the text to appear when we move from a page to another. I have seen this only in kindle e-reader. My Ectaco reader does not have this delay. I personally prefer a much bigger e-reader which I believe will make the reading much more easier. Overall, it is a good reader for the price."
"2202","love it"
"2203","love it"
"2204","Love it"
"2205","This was an unexpected Christmas present and I once said I'd never allow an electronic reading device like this in mu house because I love to hold a book in my hands and turn its pages. After learning the other features of the Kindle, I was wrong about it and I look forward to using it a lot."
"2206","Love it"
"2207","My Sister in law visited us from the US and gave me one as a gift. Awesome really nice I was using a normal Kindle before and had to have a light that ate batteries and found it super frustrating having to change batteries in the middle of the night.Well done Amazon truly an amazing product and so easy to log in and all my books are saved in the cloud so it was seamless to retrieve them and read quickly."
"2208","Well... I bought my Kindle on thursday 11th and the order arrive on tuesday 16th. I mean the shipping is really fast, even when u live in the end of the world, like me.I'm really happy with my new Kindle and above that I'm so so happy with the attention of Amazon, really. The attention is excellent, anything that you need, they WILL help you.I had some questions and I contacted them between chat and they helped me and resolve my questions.The Kindle is perfect, I loved it.THANKS AMAZON;)"

"2214","Great if you want to feel like you're still reading an actual book. Lightweight and fits easily into an averaged sized purse. Also, you can wear non-touchscreen gloves to use the touch screen which is something I was worried about when purchasing - super happy!"
"2215","This is a great gadget, thanks to the Amazon team that help me to get it,  it is so amazing to be able to get so many books in this light Kindle,  reading is a big part of my life and I love it, and getting the keyboard by touch is fantastic, the letters in my old Kindle were getting erased.Thanks againElizabeth S.,"
"2216","I purchased this Kindle to replace an old (2nd gen) device.  Very happy with the size, weight and features.  Really easy to use - but do suggest reading through the user guide to learn about all this device can do."
"2217","So far so good. I have a kindle fire that I really like but needed something I could read easily outside. Also, reading on the backlit fire for extended periods of time would hurt my eyes so this small kindle has worked well. Battery life is great. Screen is a little too sensitive but I will get used to it. All in all, for what I needed it for, I am happy with it."
"2218","I JUST LOVE IT.  IT'S COMPACT ENOUGH TO CARRY IN MY MEDIUM SIZE HANDBAG.I ENJOY READING FROM IT INSTEAD OF HOLDING A LARGE, HEAVY BOOK WITH MY ATHRITICHANDS.  THE PAGES ARE SIMPLE TO TURN.  THANX!!"
"2219","Exc++!!"
"2220","Amazing"
"2221","Love it"
"2222","I love that I can read outside with no glare!  For anyone wanting to read in a dark or dimly lighted room, do not buy this particular Kindle. This Kindle works like a regular print book and is read when light is available. I am thrilled it is strictly an e-reader, so the kids are never begging me to download games to it. Now if I could just figure out how to retire very early and read all day...."
"2223","Awesome"
"2224","Amazing"
"2225","Love it"
"2226","Love the compact size and light weight!  I was afraid I would be irritated by the small screen but it hasn't phased me one bit.  I had been using a full tablet to read but was reading less and less due to the amount of screen time every day. Now I'm back to reading every free minute I get and not getting eye strain from the back light!"
"2227","I am obsessed. At first I was a little put off by the fact that it didn't light up at all and was black and white. After using it for a few days, though, I fell in love! It's the perfect size and it's like reading the pages of a real book, except better. I take it with me evvverywhere. I don't know if I'll buy a paper book again! Also, they sell nifty little clip on book lights that are perfect for reading at night. If you're on the fence about this kindle, go for it!"
"2228","Compact for portability but big enough for reading. Love the ability to read in the sun!  I had the first generation kindle previously - nice touch screen features. Ordered a waterproof case so I can use in the pool this summer!"
"2229","I am a 20 year old college guy who has a million distractions in his life - from Xbox to his phone to class to work, etc. - and this makes me actually want to sit down and read. I always get distracted by looking on in physical books, but the Kindle helps me to focus on what I am reading at the moment - and nothing more. If you want to start reading again or just need somewhere to begin, look no further."

"2235","My 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen is just what the ""Doctor"" ordered  for my eyes!  I had eye surgery (cataracts removed from the left eye) on October 31,1914.  Reading on the  is a breeze.  The Kindle was a Christmas present.  The best present I could have received!"
"2236","I really like it. Already read my first book. The idea of thousands of books at my fingertips in an instant is very cool. Portable - light weight. Touch screen is a plus. Text is clear. If your searching on Amazon online through the kindle though the pictures are blurry. I was disappointed with the purchasing- when I thought I purchased a book series but it turned out to be just one book from that series for $15. I was unable to resolve the issue on the kindle and needed to go on my laptop to cancel the order. Amazon did provide me with a full refund which was nice. That is a separate issue from the actual device though. I enjoy the kindle and hope you do too."
"2237","love the no-glare screen.  It is so light weight, and small.  If fits easily into my purse, but big enough that I can increase the font enough to not hurt my eyes, but still have plenty of words on a page.  Perfect size for me!"
"2238","I was given a Kindle Fire and thought it was great.  And it is.  If I want to use other apps, shop Amazon or even read a magazine (color pages), but the light on the screen and the temptation to ""just check Facebook"" was not conducive to reading.  It was also bigger and bulkier and the battery doesn't last as long.  I still love the Fire and use it often, but for READING, this is my go-to device!I ordered this one just for reading and I absolutely love it.  It fits in my purse and goes everywhere with me.  I can carry lots of books with me on vacation or camping or just to the doctors office and read whatever I'm in the mood for.  The charge lasts a long time and it's readable in all sorts of lighting situations.  It's actually lighter and easier to hold than a real book."
"2239","Love it"
"2240","Luv it!"
"2241","Love it"
"2242","I have put off buying a kindle because I like reading hardbound books. However there are a lot of books I would have to order. Having the Kindle just makes those more accessible. I also like it because it's easy to hold and doesn't hurt my hands when I read for long periods of time."
"2243","Easy to read on, works great in bright sunlight, and battery life is excellent. You do have to get used to the screen going black for a moment when switching pages and navigating menu's but the other E-Readers I've had do the same.  I thought the small screen would bother me but it doesn't at all.  The ""free offers"" are just a screen saver and are worth the drop in price."
"2244","I love my new kindle!!! It's the first one I've bought, the first one I had was a hand me down.  I didn't think I would like a kindle being an avid reader and book lover but since I had a free one second generation I gave it a try and fell in love.  Gone are the bi-weekly trips to the library, lugging around arm loads of heavy books some of which I didn't have time to read or just didn't like and occasionally had previously read also the fines.  For readers like my self I recommend a paper white version I have over a thousand books on my new one already.  Most of which I got free, I don't think I have spent over five dollars on one yet.  The kindle unlimited is the way to go also.  I almost cried when I dropped my first one and broke it, I had dropped the thing a hundred times, literally.  I'm so happy with my new one it's hard to put in words."
"2245","I bought this particular Kindle because I wanted to be able to read outside in the sunshine and I am extremely pleased with my purchase! The brighter the light is, the crisper the text is. I love it! The ""special offer"" is on the lock screen only and does not interfere with my reading. I hardly even notice it. I highly recommend this Kindle if you only want to read in bright light, since it is not backlit."
"2246","perfect"
"2247","Love it"
"2248","so glad"
"2249","Love it"
"2250","Perfect"
"2251","The viewing angle of the screen is narrower than my antique Kindle.  The rim of the unit is so narrow that I unintentionally change pages, and I'm not a big fan of touch-screens on such a small space.  I haven't been able to  change settings to my preference.  I also need a way to delete old material.  Items that I deleted from my old Kindle while not on line are returning.  I don't need to keep all the samples and uninspiring books."
"2252","Perfect"
"2253","I am very disappointed.  It does do a good job outside, which is a great thing, but not so good inside.  I have to have a lot of lights on to read, my house is never bright enough to read the screen and there are not brightness controls.  In addition, i would prefer to listen to many of my books and there is no bluetooth or audio output for this to happen.  I find it difficult to navigate thru the book except 1 page at a time.  I cannot flag pages easily.  Yes it is nice to lay it down and read without holding, but i do not enjoy having to hold it."
"2254","Sooo I like the price , don't mind the little add bar at the bottom but can they do something about not being able to change brightness? Now I suppose I should done more research on it but I've never come across something like this that didn't allow brightness change... I'd have to say that's the biggest draw back especially for those who have a harder time seeing ....."
"2255","""I wasn't so sure about e-reader before.But after using kindle, I am in love with e-reader.I like books. I like the smell of papers. I like how it makes a sound when going to the next page.But sometimes it's uncomfortable. Some books are heavy. some books tear apart after a while.Hard to read in dark.But kindle fixed it all.Now i can only carry kindle when going somewhere.Easy to navigate between different books.Love this device.It changed my world."
"2256","love it"
"2257","I travel a lot and love to read. I started running out of luggage space with all the books I was buying during my travels so I decided to get a kindle. It didn't matter to me if it was the latest model or if it had a ton of cool features, I just needed to make room in my suitcase for essentials lol. It's small enough to fit in my purse and can store dozens of books! I'm very satisfied with my purchase 😊"
"2258","Awesome"
"2259","I really had to warm up to the idea of getting this kindle after the screen of my kindle keyboard got cracked. I just loved the way the kindle keyboard worked and I could listen to my book on it while driving. But I do like my new one and thou I am sad I cant listen to my books on this one I think I will live. It seems lighter than my old one and easier to tote around because itnfits in my purse."
"2260","Need a light to read it whereas the Nook does not. This was not made clear in the advertising.  I have both Kindle and Nook. The Kindle is lighter, fits in the pocket, but the Nook can be read anywhere, is larger, more words on page, seemingly more user friendly. If you like reading in bed without disturbing anyone, get the Nook. If you read in the sunshine, get the Kindle."
"2261","LOve it"
"2262","I am loving my kindle!  The battery life is amazing, the screen is perfect, and the form factor is great!If you enjoy reading or used to enjoy reading and need to get back into it, do not hesitate in making this purchase!"
"2263","perfect"
"2264","I commute to work everyday by train, and this makes it easier to read when I only have one free hand. Most days I'll have to stand and hold onto a railing, and with the kindle I can turn pages with the tap of my finger.I still prefer physical books over digital, but this is well worth the price even if its only for the convienence."
"2265","It is really, really good. I already have an Android device and I always thought ""why would I want a Kindle?"". Then I saw this version on sale and decided to give it a try. And now I just can't expect to read anything else without it. It is much, MUCH better than reading in any device with a bright display. It is just like a book - but with the upside of carrying lots of books. It does not make your eyes tired. And the possibility of using the dictionary on the fly just rocks. I am really happy with it."
"2266","Amizing"
"2267","Bought this for mother n law who is 94.  she has been reading on it for four days and only has one time where she lost her way.  i would say this a great success rate.  she loves it and wanted to know why we never got one of these new thingies when she was younger.  OMG.... the Kindle Reader is the best thing sense dirt or should i say paperbacks........"
"2268","I love this product, works exactly as described.  I can go through all the books I want, take it with me anywhere and plug it in when I get home.  I can get through an average sized book (250 pgs) without it running out of charge."
"2269","This was one great book reading device. My only issue was not being able to add my own documents to my kids library so they don't touch my progress (which would force me to by another kindle just for them)Yet, I would recomment paper white more as a better deal since reading at dark with this one is impossible and having an external light is not a good option.I managed to change the fonts in this device to display Arabic language much more better and it really did fine."
"2270","After being used to the Kindle Fire, I'm kind of sorry I bought this version to replace it (Fire no longer charging reliably). I find the smaller screen fine for reading books, but I don't like the layout for listing my books. It shows tiny, black and white book covers that I find difficult to read, in some cases. Also, it doesn't appear that I can turn the device horizontally to see larger images. Finally, on the home page the top half of the screen shows my books, but the bottom half shows books I might want to buy. I'd rather just see MY books a little larger so I can read the titles. I didn't think I necessarily needed all the bells and whistles of the Fire, since I basically used it for reading books and rarely for any other reason. But I miss the look of it, the larger screen, and the color elements."
"2271","I love my Kindle, it's a great size and fits in my backpack easily. I already have 10 books on it and have had to charge it since I got it (keeping it on airplane mode helps). It has helped me get back into reading and enjoy the books I get with PrimeFirst. It was especially great to get it on sale on Prime Day, and I would recommend it to anyone seriously considering getting one!"
"2272","Its hard to find an item that does exactly what it says, but the new touchscreen kindle has blown me away. Easy to use interface, awesome display, and so lightweight its amazing. Also very easy to move .mobi files via laptops for obtaining books from other sources. No complaints until I inevitably (albeit accidently) rocket it across the room and crack the confounded thing clean in half."
"2273","Pretty amazing device. Page turning is fluid, contrast is good. Very lightweight.Only issue has been with getting content purchased outside the Kindle store onto the reader. Amazon seems to have made this less easy than before, which is disappointing, but not deal breaking.It'd be nice if it had 3G..."
"2274","New kindle not nearly as good as my old one.  Screen on old one got cracked or I would never have changed.  New one very awkward to access my library, turning pages more awkward, and recommendations keep popping up and won't leave.  I basically hate the new machine and wish for my old one back. The old style was good and you wrecked it!"

"2280","I've had several kindles - first kindle fire, kindle touch, & 2nd (or 3rd) generation. THIS one blows  them all out of the water! I love the extras that have been added, such as Goodreads & google xray. I know xray has been on kindle for a while, but it works even better on this kindle! I love it & can't believe I got it while it was on special for $49! Even if I'd paid $100, though, it would still seem a great bargain!"
"2281","I had the original kindle and upgraded to the Fire when they first came out. I love my Kindle Fire but the screen glares to much in the sun to make reading outside enjoyable. This version is great! I love the touch screen and find the controls much easier to navigate than the original version."
"2282","I accidentally stepped on my old Kindle and knew I needed upgrade anyways. I got this one because it was part of a deal. I like that it's smaller and seems sturdier than my previous Kindle. The touch screen is easier to work with and the layout makes it easier to view my books and collections. The screen is super sensitive. If I hover my finger over the screen it tends to pull something up which can be annoying at times. However, for the price and for what I need, it works perfect."

"2288","I hate, hate, hate this product!!!! Like other customer reviews bring back the old Kindle with the buttons on the bottom and page turner buttons on the side. This touchscreen is a load of crap and you're paying more just for junk and advertisements you don't need or will use. To get started you are forced to sign up for Kindle Prime. If I had wanted that I would have signed up for it but I didn't need or want it so didn't sign up for it so wasn't happy I was forced to sign up for it to just start my Kindle. This continuous tapping to change pages is the biggest nuisance  and I have acrylic nails so it sounds like a swarm of termites on a eating binge with this continuous tapping. I travel and fly a lot for my job. I will now have to book my seat on the wing of the plane because with this continuous tapping to change pages it will annoy other passengers on the plane and they might throw me, my Kindle or both out the emergency exit. I found it very difficult to navigate to get where you need to be to read what you downloaded. I found the text difficult to read through all the smudges and handprints left through using a touch screen. I don't even like touchscreen computers! All this swiping and tapping to go back and forth you like something between an idiot and bird in flight. Someone could make a good music video showing how dumb you look doing all this swiping and tapping. I just hate it when you get use to a good product that you really enjoyed, I really liked my old basic Kindle with the buttons on the bottom and buttons on the side and had it with me everywhere I went, and they decide to upgrade and it's a load of crap and you can't go back to the old one. Like others stated if you want a Kindle you're stuck with these whether you like it or not and I absolutely hate it with a passion but I'm stuck with it because I like reading a Kindle. We should get a dissatisfied customer discount for having to purchase an inferior product to read a Kindle."
"2289","It is easy to use.  the user guide was helpful.  It works well, however the screen is very sensitive. Kindle, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers"
"2290","Absolutely Awesome hands free reading!!..  place holding and font adjustment make this the perfect gift!.. Great product!!..also Love being able to upload a book in a matter of less than a minute..too many good things about this..and so far have no bad to say about this!! Kudos!!.."
"2291","No glare and no backlight to interfere with sleep.  Great option for nighttime reading."
"2292","What happened to WHISPERNET?! I have the previous kindle and (not that it needs replacement though ive had it for about 5 years) but i wanted to have the touch. Ive been researching in the hopes of finding theres a whipernet available version but it doesnt seem to be the case. :'( i will never get rid of my current 5 yr old kindle!"
"2293","This is mostly my fault I imagine. I want to get started but I find the directions on how to start confusing. Right now I'm stuck on being connected with Wi-Fi. My Kindle was a gift. I am an  older user (85) and often find electronic mechanisms more difficult to operate than younger persons seem to do."
"2294","Seems difficult to use - NO INSTRUCTIONS providedYou must have  some kind of knowledge  - I sure can not figure how to use.Guess it saves money to not have instructions in the box. Need to go online to chat with someone everytime you have a question"
"2295","Amazing"
"2296","It is my first e-ink reader, and it really do look, feel like a paper. It would have been great if there were more popular books available on kindle unlimited. I have bought this reader mainly to replace my child's chapter books, but won't be able to replace all the chapter books as they are not unlimited service and need to buy them for quite a price^^. Still love its dictionary and word wise feature!!"
"2297","Had to replace my old original kindle and chose this unit.  My only downside I see is it is slipperier than the older version.  The older version was almost like a rubbery finish on the back making it easier to hold.. This one is just slick plastic.  I guess that's so you will buy the cover for it.  Also it is not very ""Glare-Free"", when reading at the table with the overhead lights on I have to move it so the glare on the screen is lessened. My old one was much better at reducing glare."
"2298","I love the original readers personally.  I have had the fire in the past, and after about a year or two though they had their perks they fizzled out.  Glad these are still available.  BTW Holy Speedy Shipping.  Chose the free shipping on items over $35.00, ordered it on a Sunday, MLK day was Monday and it was on my door step Tuesday afternoon.  Thanks Amazon Crew!"
"2299","I didn't think I would actually like to have a Kindle until I got one by default when we upgraded my Mother to a Kindle White with 3G service.  I love it and now am thinking upgrading sometime in the future.  It's easier and faster to read than printed books but I still love my paper and ink books too.  You won't be sorry if you buy a Kindle."
"2300","I was quite skeptical about using something electronic to read. However, I am now hooked! I love that the screen is glare-free. The battery lasts a very long time! I have been using my Kindle consistently for a week and still have almost a full charge."
"2301","This Kindle is the most infuriating thing I've ever owned -- and it is my 3rd Kindle!  I loved the first 2 Kindles.  This machine is the devil incarnate!  First there is the touch screen which is strange enough to learn, but okay, I can manage it.  Then there are the constant ads -- BEWARE!  Even after I paid the additional $20 dollars to take the ads away, I STILL HAVE ADS CONSTANTLY and suggestions that take up half my screen.  So basically I paid $80 bucks for ADS ALL DAY ALL NIGHT NEVER ENDING ADS!  I am ready to toss it or return it, but then how do I read my books? AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL -- if I could put fewer stars, I would!UPDATE -- I am not changing this review.  I have changed my kindle so that it has fewer ads on it, but there are still ads.  I have been through hours of tutorials  and online discussion groups -- I needed this?  And the upshot is I want to read my books, so I am living with the ads.  Yes, I found the place where you can turn the ads off, but only some ads.  There are still recommendations and the off screen is not James Joyce or Emily Dickinson -- no, it's a Dyson ad for a vacuum!"
"2302","Stopped  working but Amazon was great about replacing it. Called on Saturday and had my new one on Monday. Hope this one works better."
"2303","Excellent for my erotic reading."
"2304","I am not sure what happened here.  I had a 2 year old kindle that broke weeks after my extended warranty expired, so I bought this one.  It is easily twice the weight and bulk despite the fact touch technology has been around for over 2-3 years on the kindle.  Feels like a step backward.Part of why I loved my kindle was how thin and light is was.  This brick feels like I will constantly be aware of it's weight.  Also, size and shape not as easy to hold.  Kind of sad."
"2305","I love this touchscreen version.  I had one of the original readers many years before it ""died"".  This is a wonderful change for me.  Much easier to use, small, lightweight, and no glare.  Everything I wanted in a reader."
"2306","I still don't how to make the screen a little brighter it's too dark! I've called tech support twice and I'm still not satisfied. I will most likely return for a differ t kindle. It doesn't have a brightness button and that bothers me."
"2307","Just an ad for Amazon products."
"2308","I got this one after having a kindle keyboard that spontaneously shut down after years of having it.  I'm not too happy with it.  First, it DOES NOT support audiobook files which I use for long car trips.  Second, the touch screen is annoying.  Every time I have to turn a page I've gotta block my field of vision to touch the screen.  I've had it for less than a day and I'm already returning it."
"2309","Awesome."
"2310","It is easier to accurately change pages with the forward/backward switches. With the touch screen I sometimes turn more than 1 page. And unintentional touches change pages when not intended. For some reason I lost the indicators at the bottom of the page that indicated percent read and another sequence number. How do I get some indicators displayed again? Is it possible to indicate page number or remaining time to complete book?"
"2311","Perfect size for taking anywhere."
"2312","Love it! I have a Kindle Fire but missed the glare free newsprint looking screen of my first generation Kindle. My eye are less tired and I can read longer than with my Fire. Thank you for having so many options for reading!"
"2313","I ordered this to replace a Kindle that I had left on a plane and I was a little surprised to find the back cover on this version of the device is hard plastic.  Being that this is a product that by design is held in your hands when it's being used it's a jarring change from the previous models."
"2314","I am enjoying my new kindle and it's nice to be able to be outside and there is no glare on the screen.  I should have ordered this the first time.  I still use my first kindle because I have books downloaded on it.  I like the touch screen on my new kindle so I am very happy with my kindles."
"2315","I was really excited to receive this for Christmas ! It was definitely something I wasn't expecting! I'm a huge book fan so I love that this is in black and white , and easy to hold . You don't have the awkward struggle of trying to get comfy after you turn the page. The only thing is , I hate that theirs no option to adjust brightness. My eyes suck . That's the only reason I'm giving it three stars , it was a big disappointment in my case"
"2316","upgraded to the hd7 with the agreement to return this. when i went online to return this said too late. took forever for these to actually arrive....hd7 is fine but now i have this collecting dust.....also bought the paper-white kindle. all these were gifts for others......offered to give this away free and the person turned it down after looking at it and said they will buy their own hd or paperwhite."
"2317","Upgraded from the ""original"" kindle touch. What I love about this unit is that it is a lot faster. Page turns are almost instantaneous and the kindle store loads in no time. The screen is brighter and much higher res. The software extras are pretty cool if you have kids or someone who's looking to beef up their English skills.The only downsides the slide to unlock seems silly I preferred the old method of pressing the button to get to my content.Also the back was a lot better with the Original touch, the solid black back with angles feel less premium."
"2318","I love my kindle. The screen is not back lit so you do need a light to read which some might dislike however, I prefer it and I feel like my eyes don't get as tired. I love the selection they have and how quick, fast, and easy it is to get new books. Some people say it isn't really the same as reading a hard copy of a book, but I think it is very close. I chose this version of the Kindle main to encourage myself to actually read rather than getting distracted with apps. It is small, light and fits in the hands very well."
"2319","Amazing!"
"2320","Love it!"
"2321","Love it!"
"2322","Nice unit. Its easy on the eyes compared to reading on a normal tablet screen. ""Turning"" the page is a bit strange, the screen does a quick, funky pixal dance as the new page comes up. You soon get used to it and don't notice it after a few pages.  I don't like the Ads. When you turn it off, it displays a ad for a book. So it never looks like its turned off...  I'm glad I got this reader. I'm sure I'll be reading a lot more e-books now."
"2323","It was exactly what I expected, plus a little more. It reads just like a book but you can hold it in one hand easily. There's an ""experimental browser"" which lets you go to certain websites. I've been reading a free ebook online with it. Sometimes the screen is a little glitchy when I scroll, but it's an experimental browser...that usually means it's not completely perfect."
"2324","Item was delivered with expert packaging; it had plenty of bubble wrap! I love this Kindle and would recommend it to anyone who is shopping for one.  It is easy to read books and now I'm waiting for the cover to be delivered."
"2325","Love it."
"2326","exelente"
"2327","Awesome!"
"2328","Love it!"
"2329","Awesome!"
"2330","My biggest concern was the page color/tone. Too dark for my eyes, making it difficult to read for more than a few minutes.  Perhaps not an issue for the younger set. I did like being able to set the font, nice feature, as i prefer a sans serif myself. Wish the app did that. Otherwise no complaints, very light to hold. I may try the new lit version."
"2331","We had the reader with the buttons and it started to flake out on us this unit is great I love having something you can only read on, I don't get side tracked by other unit that have all the bells and whistles so I am glad kindle still has this unit and hope they never do away with it/"
"2332","I bought the kindle fire first generation when it first came out. This last Christmas I bought this kindle reader for my teenage son. He loves it. It is so light and the screen is so easy to read. I am planning on buying one for myself. The kindle fire has a back-lit screen that makes it very difficult to read books on--especially outdoors and in sunshine."
"2333","This is the first kindle I have ever owned and I just love it. It is so light in the hand and the downloads are so fast. Now that 1000 page book won't kill my wrist to hold. This was the best Christmas present ever."
"2334","The only drawback I would say are the ads every time the screen times out or you put the screen in sleep mode instead of completely off. This is what amazon means by ""With Special Offers"". In order to get rid of them you have to pay 20 more dollars which still keeps it cheaper or the same as other e-readers, but I did not like the misleading description.Other than that, I love the size, weight, and look of this kindle. This is my first e-reader and I love the ability to change font sizes, look up words on the spot, or even highlight a character name for a quick synopsis when you can't remember where that character came from. I am a huge paper book lover so still having the feel of looking at paper is a huge plus. I also like that there is no backlight because I read before bed and looking at screens with a backlight right before going to bed keeps me awake."
"2335","Love it!"
"2336","Love it!"
"2337","Love it!"
"2338","Awesome!"
"2339","I was led to believe it would do one thing and it does but not well at all.  I am really disappointed in this Kindle.  I'm still trying to decide to keep it or return it.  The touch screen isn't user friendly, the browser is a joke unless you have all day to try to get it to connect and actually do something useful and the Wi-Fi compatibility  is not up to standard.  I am considering returning it and purchasing something else.  I should have known it was too good to be true.  You get what you pay for no matter what they say it will do."
"2340","Kindle, designed for its particular function as an e-reader has many good points over a table or whatever else.First, it functions wonderfully, andSecondly, it's rugged. If you drop your tablet, its off to the store for a new one. In its case, if you drop your Kindle, it may loose your place, but it still works great.A Kindle fan absolutely!!"
"2341","Perfect."
"2342","Love the look and readability of the screen. Great to use for trips, can read several books and takes very little space. Battery seems to last a really long time.  Only downfalls... Had to buy reading light for reading at night. Friend had an older version Kindle and had some games loaded (solitaire, sudoku and battleship) I haven't been able to get any loaded on mine."
"2343","Since this is my first Kindle I like how easy it was to understand and navigate. I don't do computers very much. Only downside was that there is no back light so have to have lamp or other light source in order to read. Battery charge last very long time (about a week) before I have to recharge it. I would recommend this one for beginners."
"2344","Love it!"
"2345","Love it!"
"2346","Love it!"
"2347","Awesome!"
"2348","The device is find for an adult. I bought it for my 8 year old for Christmas. It was not clear exactly how to set it up and ad it to my account. It took almost an hour on the phone to get that done. The web page on Amazon advertising this says you can get the ""unlimited"" ""starting at $2.99"". I called Amazon prior to purchasing it to find out exactly what you get for $2.99 per month. I was told that with my $100/yr prime membership plus the $2.99/mo, that my son would be able to read for no additional charge anything marked ""kindle unlimited"" - that is not true. You get a very small set of books, most of which are too basic/young for an 8 year old for $2.99/month. To get just some of the books he wants, you need the full $9.99/mo subscription. Which is fine, but that is not what I was told before I bought it. Books don't consistently show up on it either - some showed up on my sons kindle, some of my son's books showed up on mine. Additionally, the ""free time"" application is not very intuitive - it was hard to figure out how to get books into it or the device out of free time mode."
"2349","I love my kindle.  I am to a book reader but am becoming one now. It is so convenient and compact so I carry it everywhere.  I can see the words fine without the light as long as the room is lit.  The pages turn easily and it is user friendly."
"2350","Got this for my daughter who is 11.  She has an iPad for school and loves to get library books on it to read.  We don't like her reading from it at night, so got her this.  She had been using mine but we often wanted to read at the same time.  We were both sad to find that you can't get some of the free kindle games that we love to play as a family on it, like Every Word and Dots and Boxes.  They are not available for this 7th generation.  They are great little word or strategy games.  Not sure why they are not available.  Other than that, she loves it.  Just a tiny bit disappointed."
"2351","Really enjoying my new Kindle. Reading the User's Guide has taken a while because there's a lot to absorb, but at least I can always check back when I've got a question.For years I've used Kindle apps on tablets and Kindle Cloud on the Chrome browser, so I know already how much I like reading ebooks. But I like having an actual Kindle because of the super amount of reading time on a single charge, especially when compared to a tablet!"
"2352","For what this is intended to be, it deserves five stars. It is the perfect, inexpensive, starter book reader. Thin, easy to use, compact, long-lasting battery charge, and adjustable sized fonts. There is no brightness adjustment, and you need an external light source to read after dark. The newer ones have 4gb of storage. I soon realized I wanted a few more features, and upgraged to the Paperwhite model, which does have the brightness adjustment, and internal lighting. Both models come with the same USB charging cable. You can plug them into your computer, or, many standard phone chargers work just fine, as does my iPad charger, using the Kindle USB cable."
"2353","Love it!"
"2354","Love it!"
"2355","A good reader. The only reason I give it four out of five is I'm not over fond of touchscreens; I liked the buttons on the old style better. That's just personal preference with no reflection on how the device works."
"2356","Love it!"
"2357","I have owned many kindles. I have the app on my phone and 2 tablets. I read daily for hours so l know how to navigate a kindle. This kindle is constantly changing my font size. Sometimes as many as 10 times in an hour. Very irratating. But I only have this problem with this device. All my others (my husband and daughter's) kindles are awesome along with my the apps on other devices."
"2358","I have resisted buying any distracting, portable technology but I'm glad I bought my Kindle! It is easy to use, convenient to carry and a great way to pass time while waiting in airports or in restaurants. Also, I enjoy that I can carry all my favorite books in one small package."
"2359","Love it!"
"2360","Love it!"
"2361","I got one each for my 10 and 6 year old girls for Christmas, and one for myself.  Truly one of the best Christmas presents I've given us!  Love it.  This is our first reading device so I can't make a comparison to any other product, but I can tell you we're enjoying ours very much."
"2362","This was a replacement for my 6"" e-ink previous generation (5th) ""buttoned"" Kindle, and I must say that I am very upset with how much heavier (about 15%) and bulkier it is from that one. I would've gotten that exact one had it still been available. The design of this new one is uglier, too - my old one had nice rounded edges, while this one has squared edges and looks like a thin brick. Add to the situation that it arrived a day late and this it's a bad experience all around. I do not recommend it if you're upgrading from the 5th generation ""buttoned"" Kindle, though new users obviously won't notice a difference."
"2363","I love my new kindle 6 inch reader a lot. The only problem for me is that it's not lit up. I'm used to my kindle fire 7in and my fire HDX 8.9 in that are both lit. I am going to order a reading light to attach to my new reader so that will solve my problem"
"2364","I have put of buying one of these for a long time... that was a mistake! it's light - thin - battery last a long time and easy to read!you can adjust the font size. It's great for travel and a book loads in seconds and they are not expensive. I really thought I would miss a paper book... I don't!"
"2365","Unfortunately, I've not been able to read pass one chapter with this Kindle E-reader. The pages do not change when touching and the device keeps getting stuck then turns off. This is the most frustrating thing since I am an avid reader. am completely stumped with this one. Guess I'll have to spend more money on a better reader. Not a happy customer :("
"2366","Never worked. I spent over 4 continuous hours with 2 fellows from ""Kindle"" who tried to be helpful, but were unsuccessful. Then, I was transferred to my ""network""-Optimum- and that was not successful and finally to a technician who told me it must be a faulty Kindle- sent me a label and I mailed it back yesterday. Coleen C Blanchard"
"2367","Kindle arrived, but software is not working properly. I can't open the start menu once I have opened a book, so it's impossible to return to Home screen (I have to open the dictionary abd from there go to Home). I tried reading the manual, but it wasn't very helpful because it referred to butttons that the device doesn't have. I imagine this device has the wrong software. I will contact Amazon to see if they can fix this."
"2368","Love it!"
"2369","ProsLight, fast, text is easy to read.ConsI have an old keyboard Kindle with a lot of content and collections.  The collections do not show up in the cloud along with the content that is on the old Kindle.  The collections do show up in the cloud but only if you are trying to put something into or take something out of a collection.  Also, I can find no way to bring down the collections from the cloud.  I would like to have the collections on BOTH Kindles.  Oh well..."

"2377","It's a little bit touchy/ sensitive and can accidentally change text size or highlight a word without trying but for the most part it's been great - small, light weight and long battery life. I would recommend."
"2378","This was a Christmas gift from my daughter and I love it.  My wife has had a B&N Nook for several years now and I was getting tired of borrowing it to read things.  Now we have the best of both worlds.  The Kindle gives the feel of holding a paperback sized book with out the weight and thickness that some thick paperbacks have."
"2379","UPDATE: (12/10/15) Now that I've ready about a dozen books on my Kindle with no software glitches whatsoever, I must assume that the initial problems I dealt with were resolved by one of the automatic updates. All the features have been working perfectly for the past 4 months and I now appreciate the Kindle even more than my Nook, thus I must update my review to 5-star since that's exactly how the Kindle has been working for me. It's virtually transparent when engrossed in a novel, but quick and responsive whenever you need to look up a word, find an explanation on Wikipedia, or highlight text. Excellent product!UPDATE:  (8/11/15) After initially posting a 2-star review (see below) based on my serious frustration due to having to reboot the device about one out of every three times I attempted to use the dictionary look-up or highlight features while reading, I have decided that when it DOES work properly, it's a fabulous reading device. I do actually like the way it functions slightly better than my Nook, and it's quite a bit more responsive (as it should be compared to a 5-year-old product). Overall, it's a well designed piece of hardware and if it weren't for the fact that I cringe a little bit every time I try to look up or highlight something, I would be giving it a 5-star rating. As this is an operating system issue it can be easily resolved, so I will give Amazon the benefit of the doubt on this one and hope that it gets resolve with the next firmware release. Until then I maintain that my 1st generation Nook still works more reliably.***This thing works... sort of. Compared to my first generation Nook it's complete garbage. On my Nook I could actually use the highlights and dictionary lookup features. With this piece of crap if you try to use any of those features it just freezes up so you have no choice but to reboot it. The hardware is fine, hence 2 stars instead of one, but the firmware/software is RIDICULOUSLY buggy for what I would consider to be an established product. Seriously Amazon, crap like this should have been eliminated my now. Why does my 1st generation Nook work better??? Anyhow, if you do choose to purchase this, just don't try to do anything with it other than turn the pages."
"2380","I ordered this kindle with excitement and found it really useful and convenient when I see it for the first time. I wanted to give five stars comment but unfortunately I found that there is a small area that is not as smooth as it supposed to be on the screen. It's hard to find, but once you find it, you can never stand it. Due to the departure for me, I can not ask for a replacement, but I want to remind people to be careful with the screen. Anyway, I believe the product is wonderful if it's in a perfect condition."
"2381","Love it!"
"2382","I personally love the Kindle Paperwhite. It's got a smooth, sleek feel to it and the touchscreen display is well-designed. I am able to read clearly on this Kindle product, and it even lights up a bit when the room is a bit dim. I've never had any problems reading books using the Kindle. In fact, before I received the Paperwhite, I wasn't much of a reader. Now, since it carries a huge library of books as well as the Kindle Unlimited service that Amazon offers, it is so easy to pick up your Kindle and start reading right away.I forgot to mention that this has been my most used electronic product to date."
"2383","I really love this Kindle, the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes it will jump a few pages ahead randomely and I have to find which page I'm on. It's possible that it's because of the case I have on it, but I haven't figured it out yet!"
"2384","While my new Kindle 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen has a few new features: love being able to adjust size of letters as then don't need my glasses.  My biggest complaint is I don't like touching the screen to turn page. It is way too easy to accidentally touch screen and change page when carrying from one room to another; much PREFER the older way by clicking on side of case; far less 'oops'. Only complaint with old model was keyboard at bottom; seldom used it.Did get a new cover as old ones don't fit - quite a shame as old one I used for years was easier to open; and it had a secure 'anchor' on side.Would I recommend this to others yes; but would be a YES to my old model."
"2385","Love it."
"2386","Love it!"
"2387","This is my first Kindle and I absolutely LOVE it.  I was very wary of trying an e-reader of any kind but finally decided to give it a try after learning about some interesting benefits to reading on a Kindle vs a traditional good ol' book.  I was very surprised that I ended up loving it and wishing I had bought one sooner. If you're on the fence about e-readers at all you should definitely just take the plunge and make the purchase..you will not be sorry!"
"2388","The Easter Bunny brought one each to both of my daughters )ages 9.5 and 11.5) and they love them!  They have read more in the last three days since they've had them then they had in the last 3 weeks.  They only issue I've had is being able to read the title of the book when all the books are listed on the home screen."
"2389","it is everything I expected it to believe..I am very satisfied with it...I knew that it did not have an 'internal' light..which would be nice...but manage without it nicely...great pickup for the price!"
"2390","I went for the Kindle without a light as I decided a clip on light was cheaper than the difference in price between thus and the paperwhite. After a couple updates it prompted me if I wanted to use the custom font Bookerly. I will be ordering a second kindle as my daughter who is visually impaired loved that any book could become giant print."
"2391","This is my first Kindle and though I haven't used it as much as I plan to it is a very nice device.  I thought I might have missed out by not getting the Paperwhite but the Glare-Free screen works great and the lack of back lighting is not a problem."
"2392","As always a great product, this one went to my son so when he was in trouble he could still access his books. I was going for very basic for that reason and this is just right. Love that it went on sale 3 days after I bought mine, but amazon was again great and refunded the difference."
"2393","Love it."

"2400","Love it."
"2401","I enjoyed it so much, I bought my daughter one for Christmas.  The original one that I received 5 years ago is going to be passed down to her daughter.  It is light weight, easy to hold, as I have arthritis which makes it painful to hold a book."
"2402","My old Kindle finally died. I had it for about five years.(Well done old friend) this new Kindle is at a completely different level touchscreen,  black ink like printing is very easy on the eyes. Just a real pleasure to read from. Well done Seventh generation Kindle."
"2403","This Kindle replace my Kindle Touch, which I unfortunately placed in the wrong spot and so got recycled with my old newspapers. So I have to get used to the differences. I miss the text-to-speech feature of my ""late"" Kindle and scrolling is different. I'm also not clear on how the book sharing works although we have setup some arrangement; my wife also just purchased the same Kindle."
"2404","I was surprised at how small in size it is. It's nice because your hands don't get tired from holding it. I Have rheumatoid arthritis so it's nice for me. It's non glare is nice for reading in bright light."
"2405","Love my Kindle, Kindle, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen. It does not have a backlight but you can read it with just a little light. I lost my first one on a plane the other day so I'm getting ready to buy another one because I liked it so much."
"2406","Love it!"
"2407","Love it!"
"2408","Love it."
"2409","I didn't know what to expect with the Kindle. I enjoy the ease of downloading several books to have on hand without actually carrying several books with me.  I have some trouble with the glare-free screen. So far it is great with carrying a charge and it is very lightweight."
"2410","I am simply loving this my Kindle 6"" Glare-Free touchscreen display e-reader.  The size is easy to handle and the no nonsense reading is appreciated.  Downloading books are a cinch.  I know I will enjoy this for years to come."
"2411","I bought the Kindle for my wife for Christmas and she is most pleased with her  gift  she has found the reader to be easy to use even though she is not very technically adept.  It is a plus that it was on sale when purchased."
"2412","Love it!"
"2413","Great!!!"
"2414","Love it."
"2415","Love it!"
"2416","Very OK!"
"2417","Love it."
"2418","I LOVE having my Kindle. I thought I would read too fast for it to keep up, but with the touch screen instead of the buttons, this is great! If I were reading many magazines, I would probably want the color version....I like the smaller size over my iPad...fits in my purse easily."
"2419","This is a great device. It's lightweight and the battery seems to last forever. It feels a little cheaper than the previous touch version which came with speakers and a headphone jack but who really listens to music or audio books on their Kindle these days."
"2420","I bought this on sale and it is definitely worth the price. It has exactly what I wanted for my first  eReader. It DOES NOT have a light, but I am not bothered because I knew what I was buying. In my opinion, paying more for the paperwhite is not worth it just for the light. This is the same software, but much cheaper!"
"2421","Great !!"
"2422","Great product! I've always wanted a kindle, and now that I have one, I find that I can't put it down! My only concern is that the battery life doesn't really last two weeks for avid readers like me. But it's still longer than most tablets, and the lack of games makes it easier to concentrate on my reading. If I were to add something, though, it would probably be an audio jack and mp3 capability. I'd like to listen to music or audiobooks as well."
"2423","Loved it"
"2424","I have been very hesitant to move to an e-reader rather than physical books but I have been thoroughly enjoying this Kindle. The ease of use and convenience of being able to shop for a book whenever I like and then immediately have access to it easily makes this a worthwhile purchase. Not to mention carrying it in my jacket pocket means I have a small library wherever I go."
"2425","excelent"
"2426","This was a gift from my daughter, clearly she gave a lot of thought into picking out a reader that I would enjoy. The glare-free touchscreen is just what I needed.  I get headaches because, once I start reading I can't stop. The glare-free screen is easy on the eyes and I haven't had any headaches."
"2427","Love it!"
"2428","Good one"
"2429","Easy to use. I debated between this and the paperwhite. I read the most in bed so now I am wishing I had purchased the back lit paperwhite. I'm sure I will find a case for this one which has a light included or a separate light that will actually fit into the case."
"2430","Love it!"

"2436","I liked the first Kindle - it was new and while some of the functions were clumsy, I wanted a book,not a computer. It died and Amazon was very good about sending me a new one, and even managed to put all my books on it that had been on the old one. I missed the hard keyboard - I liked the thin size - I loved that the page advance was on each side so I could move forward with either hand. I really liked how long it lasted without needed a re-charge.It too died - and Amazon sent me this. Gradual deterioration of a product. Thicker, smaller screen and now it's a touch screen, which is awkward and not helpful. Someone is captivated by graphics when all I want is a simple listing of books. Functions that used to take three clicks now take seven.Used electricity at a MUCH higher rate and no wonder, all those graphics I DON""T want. Amazon seems no longer able to replace the books on the old machine and can only come up with canned responses.The product advertising is so bad I didn't know I was ordering a touch screen - I didn't want a touch screen - and now that I have used this for several weeks, I like it less rather than more the more I use it. Yecch."
"2437","I have really enjoyed using this new Kindle.  We had purchased one of the 1st or 2nd generation Kindles several years ago and was ready for a upgrade.  That one still works well, so I already had confidence in the line of products, just wanted something smaller.  Compared to our previous version, this one is smaller, lighter, and easier to hold.  I love the touch screen feature and the ease of turning pages, highlighting, saving a place, etc.  We are very pleased with the product."
"2438","My first kindle ""died""...... I was very pleased t receive this new Kindle.  It is lighter and the glare free screen is great.  Also, it was made so easy just to have all my content moved to the new Kindle. I would high recommend this product."
"2439","Awesome!"
"2440","flawless"
"2441","Love it!"
"2442","I love this Kindle.  I was easily able to add all the e-books in my library from my computer to the Kindle with the USB cable.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and found that it is easier to read than online articles.  I do wish that the screen was a little larger, but it is about the size of a paperback."
"2443","I am rather disappointed.  My old Kindle was much easier to maneuver and the cover with light attachment doesn't fit this one.  Had I known it was not going to fit I would have upgraded to the paper white version."
"2444","I am impressed with how easy it is to read and turn pages. I however feel that is worth the extra $20 to get the one without the ads- it messes with my reading mojo. After  the ads turned on I went and paid the extra $20 to get them turned off. This was worth it. I have waited a long time to buy an e-reader and I am glad I waited to get this one."
"2445","Does the job.  Does it well.  Affordable.  Low end unit good for those of us who misplace or drop and break expensive things.Only complaint is while the included USB cable appears to be a standard variety....the unit will only connect to a PC with that cable...not a generic one.  I suppose that is documented somewhere but who would suspect?"
"2446","Frustrating. I prefer the first generation Kindle to this. The anti-glare is no better, the thing LAGS infinitely more, probably due to the (poor quality) touch screen. Probably my most frustrated purchase on Amazon, ever. My Kindle is currently frozen. I haven't had a frozen electronic device since my Windows XP 2000."
"2447","Very nice- the best e-reader I have ever owned. The size is perfect- neither too big nor too small for reading.  The black and white screen allows you to read at whatever pace you want, as it is far easier on the eyes than most color tablets. The battery life is outstanding- I read on it almost everyday, and typically go for weeks without needing to recharge.  The page turning speed is blazing fast- unlike many other e-readers that I have tried.  Very durable- my clumsy self has dropped it a few times, but it has held up well.  It is intuitive and easy to use. Overall, the best e-reader in this price range, hands down."
"2448","Love it."
"2449","Its okay"
"2450","Love it!"
"2451","I read quite a bit. 2 to 3 novels a week. I got this free on a black Friday deal. I have an ipad with kindle app and enjoy reading on that. I never saw the need for an e-ink reader. After reading on the kindle touch for a few weeks I can easily see the appeal. That being said the improvements of adjustable backlight and more importantly the increased resolution of the voyage would be must haves if I were going to pay for a dedicated e-ink reader. Are those improvements worth the premium cost of the voyage at $200, no. I could see myself buying an e-ink reader with the voyages specs at the $100 price point though. Pros: easy on the eyes, cost Cons: Slightly blurry text (though easily overlooked) and lack of a backlight."
"2452","My old kindle was sat on and broken, the new one is very nice and once registered to the same account gives me full access to all my old books.I was happy with the old one and didn't need the new features, but all the good features and readability of the old one are there.  Turn wifi off is there, but a bit hidden.  Having it off does save battery and gives a brief pause before you can buy stuff. I got the case with the cover which is a nice upgrade. I read about half my books on Kindle, even when I have both forms available.  Five real stars."
"2453","The worst thing is that it didn't have a light & I had to use a lamp to read in bed. I also had trouble downloading a book from my local library. I had to use my desktop through a USB & it still didn't work.  I returned this item for a Kindle Fire witch is so-o-o-o-o much better."
"2454","There is no brightness adjustment on this model. If you need or want this option you are out of luck. i have an older version of the basic Kindle and it was on that one. I had to return it and order the Kindle Paperwhite for $40 more. That feature should be on all models."
"2455","It's good if you make the font small then you get a lot of information on one screen.What I didn't like is the advertising that kept popping up.I even changed my setting to stop the advertising, and it continued with reading suggestions.I know what I want so, I put away and am going to the library again."
"2456","Such a convenient way to read now!"
"2457","Great product and prompt delivery."
"2458","I was a little skeptical because of the smaller 6"" screen, but actually its perfect. Its reads very clearly and it makes it less of a daunting task to read a book, you can take it anywhere, battery really does last weeks which is amazing, the ads only display as a screensaver only after about 10-15min of you not doing anything. I really enjoy it and totally recommend one to anyone that wants to read and try something new."
"2459","This is my third Kindle.  While the original and my first update operated in basically the same way the functionality of this new touch screen kindle is so much more ""user"" friendly than my first two.  I have over 600 books on my Kindle so the managing and ""ease of finding"" the book I am looking for is much simpler."
"2460","Like it much better than older model, especially the ability to flip pages even with one hand. Thinner, lighter yet with a larger screen. Still haven't learned how to easily return to the main menu to shop, etc."
"2461","Did not give this enough investigation this item enough prior to purchase. It does fine for what it was designed for but I wish I had paid more attention to the size prior to ordering.  My daughter does not like to use it because it is small and if any pictures, they are only in black and white."
"2462","very good"
"2463","very good"
"2464","Excelente"
"2465","No, I though It had a build in light."
"2466","I love the size its perfect for work."
"2467","The Kindle Fire tablet seemed very complicated at first, but after a while, I got used to it and now find it easy to find my way around and navigate the various options. I love it for listening to Audible books and reading Kindle books. But most of all, I love to watch Amazon Prime videos like Mozart in the Jungle. The Fire Kindle is convenient for both watching and listening, and I can pedal on my exercise bike, while I do both activities! The only problem is I get fingerprints all over the glass--more of them the more I use it--and I don't know how to remove them."
"2468","Pretty solid device.  The touch response is very good.  I didn't want a touch screen ereader but took a chance and I've been very surprised at the performance.  I've been through an original 1st gen kindle and a 3rd gen kindle keyboard so I have a little experience.  I wish I had jumped on this for the $59 holiday price but $79 is still good for a brand new kindle."
"2469","Extremely happy with my new Kindle. I'm a first time owner/user of an e-reader,  and I don't think I could go to a different brand after using a Kindle. I commute to work everyday on the subway, so reading an actual book can become cumbersome as it can get in the way. But with my lightweight and small kindle, and can hold onto it with one hand and turn the pages with my thumb. I love it!"
"2470","Lightweight and easy to use.  Can switch from one book to another with minimal effort.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have the capability to play games, which is something that I like to do.  That was not made clear to me when I purchased it.  Otherwise, a good product."
"2471","I got the kindle with the sole purpose of just trying to read more and man did it help. It was way lighter and smaller than I thought it was going to be. It's definitely a lot easier to hold than a traditional book. Overall, I loved it, very user friendly, light, and can hold so many books."
"2472","I ordered this because my first kindle died completely and I love reading books on a kindle. I must say, I love how many books I can have at my fingertips. But, the one thing I do not like is how cheap it feels. Like really cheap plastic. And the touchscreen is wayyyyy too sensitive."
"2473","Really happy with it, upgrading from an older model. I like that it doesn't have back lighting cause that strains your eyes and makes it harder to sleep at night. I wish there was a 3G option for when I travel and wifi isn't available like in some airports, but overall very happy with it."
"2474","easy read"
"2475","Is great!"
"2476","Very good"
"2477","Purchased this for my nephew who wanted to read more. Inexpensive by comparison, and perfect for young readers.Nice features that allow you to track your child's reading progress and word power.Perfect for anyone who wants to read without the excessive frills.This is a NON-illuminated product, which is a refreshing change for kids staring at illuminated screens all day.It is also simple black & white. Less distractions & more imagination.Highly recommended."
"2478","Just used it for a week reading poolside- absolutely no problems.  I updated from a Kindle 2nd generation to this version.  Love the difference in weight and design from old one - so much lighter and smaller yet large screen to read"
"2479","its great"

"2484","Yeah....I really enjoy using this.  It is my first Kindle and for the $49 price tag on Black Friday, it was hard to say no.  It is easy on the eyes and its great to use, especially in my office.  Many users that I see posting on here mention the buttons on the previous versions of the Kindle and I have to say that I definitely can understand the advantage of having buttons versus the touch screen.  Sometimes the touch screen isn't as responsive as I would like it to be.  For me, it doesn't detract from the 5 star rating I gave it because everything else is so user-friendly."
"2485","Excellent"

"2490","Great buy"
"2491","Very pleased with my touch kindle.  I upgraded to this one after owning the keyboard kindle that lasted me for 4 plus years.  I thought I would struggle with the new kindle, but had no problems at all.  Really love it.  I also ordered the elsse cover for about ten dollars and I am very pleased with it too.  Happy Reading!"
"2492","Amazing! I teach people to download ebooks. I figured it would not hurt to have an e-ink Kindle since so many people I teach have them. It comes with the ebook of the kindle manual, which I read. It mentioned an ""experimental web browser,"" so what can it do? You no longer need a computer to download an ebook from a library using Overdrive. You can browse most sites without a problem. Sure, it's a little slow, and B&W, but it works very well. I read my e-mail! Thanks Jeff B, another Amazon innovation!"
"2493","I bought this for my wife. She no longer reads much because of her eyesight.  Now, she reads every day, using the largest font. She's not gadget-friendly, so I picked this unit for its simplicity.  Best gift I gave this year."
"2494","I have purchased many different kindles. Although they all have their uses my favorites for reading remain the ones with no backlighting. I like the size and light weight of this kindle. It makes it easy to slide into my purse and go!"
"2495","I bought this when Amazon had a big sale on them.  Normally I use an Android tablet to read on.The Pros:-Light weight-Excellent battery life-Crisp text-Resistive touch screen is responsive and can be used with objects, gloves, etc.The Cons:-Small screen-Crisp text but doesn't look like a book page (the Paper White version is better I think)-Slow to respond-No progress bar like all the Kindle apps have and less features than the apps for other devices.  I'm sure a firmware update could fix this.-Feels cheaply built-No backlight/hard to read in dim light"
"2496","Nice upgrade from the original Kindle that I have owned for years.  I prefer to read books on a dedicated e-reader without the glare so I can read anywhere I want..outside, inside in my bed before I go to sleep and this does the same as the original.  I like that there is no longer the keyboard at the bottom too.  The touchscreen turns pages quickly and more quickly than my original Kindle did.  I am glad I upgraded after my other Kindle finally bit the bullet.."

"2501","Fair deal"
"2502","I got the Kindle as an addition to my ipad as it's too difficult to read on the ipad due to glare and brightness, especially outside. But this version of the Kindle has the opposite problem - it's too dark to read!  Really strange that they found such a grey background to be acceptable. Going to give the next one up a try, perhaps, though it's more than I want to spend."
"2503","Small... seriously, why does my phone get larger and my ebook reader get smaller? One goes in my pocket, the other goes in a carry on bag or backpack. I see no reason to limit the size of the screen on my e-reader and will pay a premium for the extra space, and/or easier handling of the device. If I wanted to crowd around a device that would fit in the palm of my hand, I'd use my cell phone. Where did my Kindle Keyboard go? What a marvelous device that was...."
"2504","This more of a question as I love the Kindle.  Are the covers/cases supposed to fit so tight that they don't close properly?  Please e-mail me back as I need to know if I should get a different case/cover  1wackywac@gmail.com."

"2510","I think I am used to a lit screen, so having a Kindle with dim screen was tough to get used to. I love it though! Light, you pack it easily, easy to use. It is a bit tricky to figure out how to ""borrow"" or ""buy"" books, but I think I got it."
"2511","I would give this Kindle a five star review but for one thing:  There is constantly an advertisement on the screen trying to sell me a book I have absolutely no interest in.  I suppose that is why this model ""with specials"" was 30 bucks cheaper than usual.  Unfortunately, Amazon never explained what ""with specials"" meant.  I wish I could get a software upgrade to eliminate the ads.  Shame on Amazon!"
"2512","My daughter absolutely loves it. I had to buy it to replace the Nook she had that I lost on her. Thought I would teach her a lesson because she was always leaving it laying around so I put it away... I still can't find after a year... so I purchased this Kindle and she likes it even better than the Nook. Thank you."
"2513","I really like being able to turn the page by just touching the screen.  The first Kindle which I had for a very long time was anoying because I had to push the sides to change the page.The only negative is not knowing what page I'm on.  I've never liked the percentage concept to tell me where I am in the book.  Wish they would come up with a way to number the pages like a real book.It travels well and is small enough to put into my handbag so overall it gives me what I need in a reader."
"2514","What a difference 4 years makes.This new Kindle, is so light! I love that it actually tells you what page you are on! It even tells you how long it will take you toFinish the book! It's pretty solid , not As many crevices where sand/ dirt can get into. Great size , easily fits in purse."

Selecting a word and getting the definition is super easy from anywhere in the text. Typing on the touch screen is easy. I took the Kindle to the beach and under the full sun or under the umbrella there was no glare at anytime."

"2527","Just love it.  Having a bit of trouble getting used to it since I was used to the older version.  Do not like the way the books are displayed.  Can't tell which ones I have read in the past since all my books were downloaded.  I am sure I will get used to it."
"2528","I love my Kindle. I love that I have all my books with me where ever I go. I love that if there is an unfamiliar word I can tap it and find out what it means. I love that if I forget who a character is I can tap it and find out who that character is.  I love that I can keep track of what books I've read on Goodreads and Kindle.Amazon.com. The only thing I don't like is how the My Clippings folder works."
"2529","I love having a Kindle. I was hesitant to get an eReader but fell in love with them this year. It's lightweight and portable. I love that I can read it outside without a glare and that I can store multiple books on it. I am able to read books for a low cost with the library loans and the Kindle borrowers library. I am thrilled with this purchase and encourage even the most skeptical to give it a try!Also, I bought a case for it and it gave me that ""book"" feel I had been missing"

"2535","Very satisfied with my new Kindle that I received as a Christmas gift. I am able to purchase books from a wide selection with just the click of a button. Books are available for reading within minutes and for a reasonable price. Very readable, even in sunlight---exceeded my expectation.I would recommend purchasing to a friend."
"2536","Simple, functional, no hassle. Does what it's supposed to do. I don't know about all the features compared with Nook, etc...I just know that it works for me and was inexpensive. For what it's worth, I dislike advertising in almost any form, but I find the ""special offers"" to be quite tolerable...they don't interfere with reading because they are only visible when the device is 'at rest'."
"2537","While I like this Kindle it doesn't present graphics (maps in the case of the first book I am reading) in regular font or ""print"". The entire map is ""faded"" and hard to read, i.e., map characters and word font are so ""light"" that it is very hard to read the map. I had to use a magnifying glass under a bright light to read the maps."
"2538","As far as I'm concerned,it's a piece of junk.  The first thing I noticed was that it refused to show me all the books I had purchased.  I could get 6, but it refused to show me the other 15.  The home page at top won't some up no matter how I try to get it. I managed to open a book and got it somewhere near the page I had been reading on my old kindle, but the dictionary kept popping up when not required and I couldn't get rid of it.  Everything froze.  I couldn't turn pages in either direction, I couldn't call up the home page, I couldn't even turn the machine off - when I tried, the page with the frozen dictionary would still be on the kindle and it stayed there.  When I tried to turn it off a second time and possibly reset the thing, the same page with the dictionary was still there.  Nothing I touched would coax it to leave.  I tried to turn it off again and a popup shot up in front of the dictionary and asked me if I wanted to cancel, restart or produce a blank page, but I couldn't do any of those things.  It just sat there and wouldn't go away.  The page wouldn't turn, the home banner at top wouldn't appear -- nothing worked.  I couldn't get rid of the dictionary and then a ''wise word'' screen showed covering up the dictionary and it wouldn't go away.I would ask you to replace this trash if I wasn't worried about getting another just like it.  Will you take it back?  If you won't replace it, it's going into the garbage can where it undoubtedly belongs."
"2539","Perfect size to fit in a small purse or bag.. I bought a skin for it with a front to protect it from, well, me. Have only read less than 12 hours over a span of two weeks, but have yet to need to charge it up."
"2540","It's a simple Kindle, but it's super convenient and durable. The battery lasts long and I've accidentally dropped it a couple of times, and there are barely any scratches left. I'm super happy with this."
"2541","love it!!"
"2542","The product is great for reading, the touchscreen is sometimes lagging and yo it could be good adding dictionary of english to spanish offline would be great or search a word inside another word definition."
"2543","I wanted an e-reader that I could read outside with me, and this one is great.  I was used to using the app on my I-pad, but I quickly got used to using this one.  I highly recommend if you are looking for a kindle."
"2544","The resolution is actually much better than what I expected. Even better for the fact that it does not have a back light because that's what a e-ink reader should be. Got it on cyber Monday. Very good deal."
"2545","The only feature that I did not like was the fact that it does not have an internal light for reading at night. However this feature is available in the newer kindle models. It is small and I can travel with it easily stowing it in convenient places such as a purse, backpack, and even cargo pants"
"2546","awsome :)"
"2547","omg i hate the touch screen. do you read on the subway? well, i hope you only ever want to hold the kindle in your right hand. i'm constantly accidentally turning the page, and making the text giant. impossible to read and turn pages with one hand (can only do this with my right hand).  good luck. bring back the old non-touch screen!"
"2548","I avoided buying a Kindle for a long time.  Now, after owning one for a month, I have no idea why!  I love it and love that my habit of reading multiple books at once can be hidden because I have them all with me at one time and no one knows but me!"
"2549","After lugging around a 10.1"" tablet for nearly 5 years now, and hacking new versions of Android on it just so I could continue to update software I realised that it was time to upgrade my hardware. This decision was only decided after receiving a nice bonus from work and finally justifying a technology upgrade after hour upon hour of internet research. I decided to go with something advertised as having a long battery life and built to serve the same purpose as my dieing 10.1"" Tablet that was so old it could only really be used to read books. That old hacked relic still works though mind you. I work offshore and often we do not have the luxuries of TV or internet available when weather is bad and books suffice the only form of entertainment available next to twiddling your thumbs until you go out of your mind. Even when weather is good I can only handle taking hours for a section of Facebook to load due to slow satellite internet speeds. Prior to my most current venture offshore (now as I write this) I was ordering a new XPS13 to replace my also dieing antique Intel atom powered netbook. Low and behold I see an advertisement for a payment plan to get a Kindle. So I say what the hell adding a measly 15$ to a well researched and high-cost laptop purchase isn't going to break the bank. All of this occurred prior to going back to work. What joy I had when receiving the new toys to replace the old stone age relics I was lugging around for entertainment. Not to mention the weight reduction with modern devices when carrying them in my backpack while on deck. I tested both devices to confirm their functionality to determine if I would need to send anything back before embarking on airline flights, bus routes, and a helicopter ride before being trapped out at sea with only books and a handful of movies on a hard drive. So I plugged the Kindle into my brand new laptop and uploaded the novels, Dungeon Master's Guide, and PDFs of useful technical manuals for my work (I'm an electrical technician) from my tablet to the Kindle. Everything worked, I was able to test both devices simultaneously. So after opening a couple books I confirmed it is certainly a thing that does make books happen. Packed it up and prepared for the long journey and after my wife dropped me off to the airport and I made through TSA without being too molested I open my bag to continue reading George R.R. Martin's Feast For Crows...the Kindle only displays screen artifacts. No soft-reset attempts work or help. No amount of charging throughout the trip from my 2.1A battery pack help...I won't get those 18 hours of agonizing boredom back. I did however try charging it from the wall outlet nearly 12 more hours when arriving to my ship with no further change or improvement and have begun the Amazon troubleshooting process so we will see how that goes...but I am still on the fence on whether I want to feed it to the sharks or not. Considering our internet connection while in the middle of the ocean is 56K dial-ups ugly cousin it may very well be that by the time this review posts i may be back on shore or an aging man retiring from a career of offshore work who knows, but if I am able to get through to Amazon and work something out I will update this further.Meanwhile Forever Yours,Long time Amazon Prime Shopper and enthusiast...disappointed by latest future book technology."
"2550","I love it"
"2551","Absolutely love it! I had the original kindle and just upgraded. I didn't think I could love anything more than my first kindle but the shape and size of this one is even better. It's easy to use and you can read for hours without getting a headache or straining your eyes!"
"2552","This product is exactly as advertised and I suspect it will work as well and as long as my original Kindle.I do terribly miss having the page turning buttons as well as menu/home button that the original model Kindles have.  I would very much like to see Amazon re-introduce these features on the newer Kindles."
"2553","A joy to use and a welcome change from the glare of monitors and tablets. The reader is inexpensive and very good value. Many books are either free or less than a dollar and the ability to download chapter samples before you buy gives you an informed purchase choice."
"2554","Received as a Christmas gift and being a avid reader this was a great present. I am loving the quick downloads and everything this Kindle has to offer to make reading more enjoyable. Thanks Amazon for this Kindle product. It is well worth the purchase if you love to read."
"2555","My boyfriend loved his kindle as a gift. Its small, and the touch screen is great. Its easy to upload books and he has been glued to it since last night :) Oh also I got it on sale! Makes it that much sweeter!"
"2556","Let me start by saying this is my favorite purchase I have ever made. I have not read a book in ages and I thought that my old love for reading was gone. I am a high school student and this kindle helps me in every way. Wether by entertainment or me learning new vocabulary with it's amazing dictionary functionality I couldn't ask for anything more. This is truly an amazing device. I have rediscovered a long gone passion and am truly grateful. My only complaint would be the resolution. When on a smaller font the lack of ppi is noticable. However, it doesn't take away from the experience."
"2557","Lightweight, easy to use. Recommended cover is not as substantial as the first Kindle cover, but it is very light. This new Kindle Basic does not turn off all the way apparently. WHen you close the cover, it goes to sleep, then wakes up when you open the cover."
"2558","Received my Kindle for a Christmas gift and I love it.  It is so easy to purchase books except I do not have wireless in my home so I have to go 11 miles to the nearest free WiFi.  I really like the easy reading and also the choice in letter size.  It is so easy to bookmark and then return to the same page. It is very convenient to take with me wherever I go.  I also purchased the Kindle carrying case and that makes it so easy to hold."
"2559","I love it"
"2560","Awesome!!"
"2561","I was looking for something to replace my newspaper ever morning. It was getting difficult for me to search for my paper every morning with MS getting worse. On the few days I was able to track it down it was often too wet to read. I thought there had to be a better way. The kindle fit the bill for me. I am now able to get my newspaper every day, it's dry, I can handle it with one hand, ever on windy days at one fourth the cost."
"2562","I ordered 3 on Thanksgiving, two for my children, they seem to like it very much because they carry it everywhere to read books. The other one is for myself, I haven't start it yet, I wish it works well."
"2563","I needed to do more research before buying this one, when I got it in the mail i was very surprise bc I thought it was going to be bigger, but its ok. I'm happy with my Kindle and Im loving it. Also, you can't read where there's no light."
"2564","It is amazing, no more paperback stories for my kids, it's easy for them to use and download what they like,and the most important thing that there is no screen light which make it safe for their eyes."
"2565","I love it"
"2566","Good deal"
"2567","Excellent"
"2568","I needed a Kindle to read in the sunlight. I had a first generation Kindle which after many, many years failed to hold a battery charge longer than a day. It still works and I am letting a friend use it. I love all the kindle products. They are priced fairly and the ease with which they work is amazing. I use it all the time. This was a gift from my daughter for Christmas. While I do not like the advertisements I see when I turn the device on and off, they haven't been offensive and she saved $20. This is the tool for anyone who loves to read."
"2569","Love the ability to have multiple books on my person at any time.  great for someone who is reading a number of books at the same time. One comment to improve is that the browser can not download PDFs but if you have full feature computer you can download and transfer the files to it.  Also a default option for showing larger versions of illustrations in books.  In certain cases you can tap on image and it will open a full screen version and in other instances it will move to next page."
"2570","After charging the device, I attempted for nearly an hour to use the touchscreen keyboard and register it. Unfortunately, when I touched a letter or number, either (1) nothing happened, or (2) the correct key was highlighted but one NEXT to it on the screen was input!  After too-many-to-count times of using the back arrow key to erase and start over, I finally got my user name and password onscreen. Would you say that is not very effective use of my time?Well, it got WORSE. When I pressed the correct Wi-fi network for my home, the one BELOW it on the screen was input and using the back arrow did nothing.I phoned Amazon Kindle support, and the agent told me I'd have to download the software (which she said wasn't loaded into the Kindle) onto my computer, and then load it into the Kindle via USB. After about ten minutes more of frustration (with nothing online where she told me it would be and her suggesting I change USB ports), I told her I no longer wanted a Kindle. I have better uses for my time. If I want to read an e-book, I'll read it on my laptop (which performs as it should).I am returning it for a refund today."
"2571","while actually reading, it's great, screen's clear and easy on the eyes. The biggest problem is trying to browse my library to get a book, there's reading suggestions and other things that take up space on the front page. I was used to using the Kindle app for my iPad, so this was a bit of a difficult transition. Also some people may be aware of this, I was not when I ordered, there are no speakers or headphone jack so you can't use it with audible/whispersync"
"2572","Battery does indeed last days, even with heavy usage (I'm getting roughly 8 days off a full charge, reading on it between 4 and 7 hours per day). Easy to navigate, easy to set up Wi-Fi and turn Airplane Mode on and off, and easy to change font styles, sizes, and margins. Best investment I've made for the amount of travel I do."
"2573","i like it"
"2574","excellent"
"2575","gooooood!"
"2576","Love new Kindle. Wonderful at thr beach last week. People asked about compact size. I am a great spokesperson for Amazon.I have owened seven. Read ""Try Dying"", ordered next book in series...fun vacation reads. Hooked on legal thrillers. Keep them coming."
"2577","My biggest gripe is that there is no way to have a case that has the light built in like my kindle with the keyboard had. Otherwise the kindle itself is good. Still getting used to it but no complaints really"
"2578","I received this as a Christmas gift from my sister, and I couldn't be happier. I've been saying I wanted one for years, but never bought it. I am a avid book reader, so it's great to have all of my books in one place. I really like the glare free screen, and the fact that you can change the font size. The kindle is a really convenient size (not too big, not too small). Wi-Fi compatibility is a huge plus. I would definitely recommend this product."
"2579","It works perfectly but I have the fire and used to have the original WiFi and this one just seems cheap.  Lighter and more of a cheap plastic feel.  I bought it because I don't like the Fire when I'm out in the sun but while the screen is great I just can't like the unit as a whole.  So I bought a used earlier model.  Will sell this one or give it to a relative."
"2580","there are no instructions for dowloading library from old kindle to new kindle.  i have not been able to use the new one because of this.  i realize there are instructions on the kindle but nothing i could find about switching between old and new"
"2581","I like it"
"2582","sent back"
"2583","I love it"
"2584","It's good"
"2585","It is very light and portable. When I am reading with it, my eyes are much more comfortable comparing using ipad and iphone. It is definitely worthy to have one even though this does not have light itself. However, I think it is better to read in a good environment rather than reading it in a dark place with the light."
"2586","The kindle glare free does not have color, is made of plastic, has poor display, and also looks like an oversized calculator. Although this all is true and is not to much of a proble, the Kindle has wifi which allows it able to connect to the Amazon store. The kindle only has two uses which both meet if not standards but above; reading and buying books."
"2587","I was very disappointed to find that after I bought this Kindle 6, it didn't have a light.  The writing is dim and it's very hard to read unless I'm in a room with a bright light.  Since I enjoy reading after going to bed at night, this Kindle just doesn't do it for me."
"2588","For those who love read, this is for you!"
"2589","A lot to learn but think it will be great"
"2590","Do you know this Kindle doesn't have a light?  I didn't and if you look at the description it doesn't mention it unless you do a side by side comparison on a whole different web page.  Without the back,light it's very dim to read in ordinary dull daylight and impossible in a darkened room, camping, airplane.  Make sure you check this out.  I've purchased several other kindles but this is the first one I've run across without lighting.  It's going back."
"2591","I honestly bought it off impulse and didn't look at the box or product in its entirety. I thought they all came with internal lights which they don't. That light is about $60 bucks more. I do most of my reading at night while in bed so Im not too sure this is going to get as much action."
"2592","love the light can read anywhere anytime"
"2593","so glad i broke down and bought one....."
"2594","I bought this to take to the beach. Didn't want the salty sea spray invading my Kindle Fire.  Glare free screen works well but the screen is somewhat too sensitive, a slight brush against it & it changes the page."
"2595","The screen flickers when ever I touch it..."
"2596","Just excellent.Everything and much more than I was expectin for the device, it allows a good management of the book, it is ""Paper like"", and the most important thing is that it helps a lot for reading in english, because english is not my mother toungue, nontheless having helps like Wise word or the Oxford dictionary integrateds in the Kindle have been such a huge help for me.5 well gained stars for this device!"
"2597","A grand e-reading device from someone slavishly in love with paperbacks that begrudgingly uses one. Sometimes I miss the simplicity of the original Kindle, and the error-free page forward and back buttons. The touch functionality can result in some unexpected pagination results, but overall, a great product. The Goodreads integration is absolutely divine."
"2598","Kindle is very slow and sometimes unresponsive when I ""tap.""  I can get it to work, eventually, but frustrating. I've read the instructions twice.Not sure if I should send it back or not."
"2599","I love it!"
"2600","I love it!"
"2601","Nothing about my new Kindle is better than my old one..except the size!  My library is difficult to find, way too many advertisements!!!  really sick of that..difficult to find and move around in a book..sorry I sent in my old one!!  how shortsighted to listen to your advertisement and fall for it!!Not again Amazon!"
"2602","Killed it Immpediately. Worthless quality."
"2603","Great for the price.  I have a Kindle HD that I use mostly, but needed something I could use by the pool or at the beach.  I didn't want to spend a lot since it's not my primary Kindle.  This refurbished model is perfect for my needs."
"2604","I noticed that the prices (for the Kindle E-reader)  does NOT include the power supply, which costs a hefty $20.00.This is a bait and switch strategy.  Bait people in with a lower price, but then add $20 for the power supply.The power supply should always be included in the price, since it is necessary for operating the device."
"2605","LOVE IT!!!"
"2606","Fantastic!"
"2607","I enjoy it"
"2608","Very good!"
"2609","The worst part about this device is the software updates. I received my Kindle on Nov 22 and have already had to updated my software 3 times and its the second week of January. I have yet to purchase a book on this device and have it immediately show up. I must plug it into my computer, update software, and manually add my books from my desktop. I've done this with 4 books. Lots of work for a brand new device."
"2610","This works perfect for me. I was tired of the backlight on my phone killing my eyes so I bought this. I love that it looks just like a book page. It is just the right size for my purse too! It makes it easy to always have a book when you get stuck somewhere having to wait"
"2611","The kindle was a perfect gift for my 10 year old daughter.  My daughter got one for Christmas and had been reading on it everyday since. My son wants one now as well.My daughter had difficulty with understanding what she is reading at times, due to not knowing the definition of a word.  She can now look up the definition while she is reading rather than asking someone later and taking all information in at once."
"2612","I'm totally satisfied with my Kindle Glare-Free (7th generation). Reading e-books was never as easy as it is right now!Vocabulary Builder software is also amazing! It is helping me a lot to further learn new english words!"
"2613","1.Simple package but very cost effective. With no useless rubbish inside.2.Battery life:feels like about 15-18hours continuous reading is ok, not very precise. I tested twice, first time about 4days, every day about 3,4 hours reading. Second time, 7hours reading a time, more than 50% battery left.3.Reading performance ok, various of format available, with ordinary and special function for better reading4.Service good, can response in short timeA very happy shopping experience."
"2614","I received this as a birthday gift and I absolutely love it. It's light weight and very easy to navigate between screens. The fact that you are able to get the look of a real book in text is what this kindle is all about. Navigating to purchase books and to access good read is a breeze. I highly recommend  this kindle!"
"2615","Good product for the price... But i guess Amazon must incorporate a feature so that we can download audio books abd listen it over this device.Also, the screen is great is brigth light, but is ureadable in low light situations. I guess a backlit display would help better...Over all a great product for this price!!!"
"2616","I didn't know how to operate the kindle and wish you had included a paper instruction sheet which would have helped me start.  It was a hunt and peck guess work for the first couple of times and contrary to my other kindles, I don't know how to call for help.  I saved the sheet from the second one I have fortunately.  I love how light it is; the first  one helped break a strap on an expensive purse I took on a trip.  Barbara Volin"
"2617","I love it!"
"2618","Wonderful!"
"2619","Great deal"
"2620","Very good."
"2621","I love the touch screen. I think the kindle's ink is really sharp. It is so much easier to read on then a tablet. I didn't think I would ever convert from paperbacks to a kindle, but I do love the convince. I am glad that I don't have book clutter any more."
"2622","I am SO pleased with my Certified Refurbished Kindle. It reads well and is so lightweight. I can take it anywhere with me and it's not bulky. I love the highlighting function and the ease with which you can change font size. I have already downloaded six books that I can't wait to read!"
"2623","I've had 3, yes THREE, kindles.  All 3 have died due to charging malfunctions. The first 2 were quickly replaced by Amazon customer service free of charge. Because this 3rd one FINALLY made it past the warranty deadline, I've been issued a huge screw you by Amazon. EXTREMELY disappointed in them and their once stellar customer service. DO NOT BUY! I've been very careful with mine always, have a protective case, put it up  where little hands can't reach, never been dropped, charged it exactly as specified., etc.  save your money and buy something higher quality instead."
"2624","It was very lightweight and easy to use."
"2625","I purchased this Kindle to replace an older version that finally wouldn't work any longer.  I actually like my old Kindle's ""push-button"" feature better to go back and forth from the pages.  I read in bed, and it accidentally slipped a bit in my hands and I somehow ended up many chapters ahead from where I was reading. It was a bit of a hassle (and annoying) to go back to where I was. I guess I'll get used to it. I am also a bit disappointed it didn't fit in my old Kindle's case as it is smaller - would have been nice if it was made adaptable to it since the cases aren't cheap.  Other than those ""complaints,"" I love reading from my Kindle.  The screen really is glare-free.  I often read from the Kindle app on my phone if I don't have my Kindle, but that doesn't work well outside because of the glare.  No problem with the Kindle."
"2626","I don't know if I ordered wrong or what.  But I can't say I like this one as much as the one that suddenly stopped wroking.  I am somewhat disappointed. When I get some money together I'll buy a newone."
"2627","I love my Kindle so much more than I ever had expected to. It's great. I read quite a bit more on this e-ink device than any of my full color display tablets. It's far easier on the eyes and allows me to sleep easily afterward, which isn't the case with my tablets."
"2628","Great size. Fits in one hand, which is great when I'm commuting on the train.  Does what I need it to do, which is to have access to my hundred plus books and read without bells, whistles or distraction."
"2629","Brilliant!"
"2630","I love it."
"2631","Amazing. I didn't think I wounderstand be into much but I love it. Long battery life. No glare. Easy on the eyes like a real book. I love how small it is so I can put in my purse. I also love how no one knows what you're reading."
"2632","I really like it now that I have gotten used to it. I haven't got the light touch mastered yet, it keeps changing the font at will, lol. It's just the right size, the battery lasts longer than my first kindle and I like the background, it's easy on my eyes."
"2633","I received this as a gift and it is my first e-reader. I would highly recommend for first time users! Great value!  I love how user friendly it is. Since large books tend to be daunting, I love the feature to hide what page you are on...I find myself actually reading more and checking my progress every-so-often. I also use in conjuction with Amazon Prime / Kindle Unlimited and Goodreads site."
"2634","I love my new Kindle...I use it when I travel and at home. its perfect for me as it is light weight and so easy to carry.  I am in my 50's I cannot carry alot in my carry-ons anymore, the screen is small, so my reading glasses are a must, as in most cases... Its quick, its fun, and its a Amazon product...I will purchase more Amazon products in the future.  They have my Vote!"
"2635","The extra gifts are mainly advertisement. It's a small device, easy to handle and not heavy. Reading with it is the almost the same as reading paper books. You'll need a book light if it's dark, no glare outside. Easy on the eyes, which is great!  Not friendly for PDF files reading. Good overall, considering the price. However, if you can go for a newer model, I would recommend to do so."
"2636","Great gift"
"2637","Excellent!"
"2638","It's great"
"2639","Love it..."
"2640","I love it."
"2641","works well"
"2642","been using it for about a week now and I love it! very user friendly...wasn't sure if I was going to like the ""swipe"" feature..my last kindle had the ""turn page"" button, but i love it. Held a charge for over a week. no complaints."
"2643","If you're wondering about getting a Kindle, I can say without reservation that it is one of the best purchases I've ever made. The access to out of print classics, the fresh writings of new authors and everything in between has provided me with uncounted hours, days, weeks of great reading. I can honestly say that my Kindle has paid for itself just from the savings I've gotten from just one author. Add to that the fact that the cubic footage of storage no longer required for my books has seriously reduced the clutter of my life!"
"2644","I really like this reader. I thought the special offers would be really annoying but they are not. This Kindle is not back-lit but, the print is clear and easy to read. Some people may not like turning pages by touch screen but this works well for me I, also like the built in dictionary and high lighting features. For an entry level reader this is great. This is my first reader; I will more than likely eventually upgrade to one of the other 3G+wireless Kindle."
"2645","I love it!"
"2646","I love it!"
"2647","Excellent!"
"2648","I fully enjoy my Kindle.  I am on hospice and housebound...I love to read and now I am still able to shop for books and can sample them.  The only complaint is the smallness of the keyboard and the letters.  Surely with your expertise you could offer a full sized keyboard that could be attached (like a flash card is attached) to compose responses and then disconnected...I do not send responses because I cannot read the letters and continually mistype to start over because the letters on the board are so small....is there a separate email address to critique what I read?"
"2649","While I still like the convenience of my new Kindle reader, I am very disappointed with this 7th generation model. I previously had the original Kindle with the keyboard built into the device its self, which I absolutely LOVED!! It is supposedly an advance to have a touch pad, but it is very annoying! If you put the Kindle down, if anything passes close to the screen or if my dog walks between me and the screen, it advances about 20 pages! And it is VERY difficult to get it to go backwards, usually requiring about 5 minutes of ""fiddling"" with the machine to get it back to the right page, totally destroying the enjoyment of the book. I REALLY REALLY MISS my old Kindle!!! I REALLY WISH Amazon still sold them. They were GREAT!"
"2650","I purchased this product as a Father's day gift.My father is 87 years of age and of sound mind.The product was packaged properly and delivered unharmed and on time. However, we, my father and I, were unable to register the device in order for him to start reading books.We tried several times, but could not get passed that ""code"" that MUST BE ENTERED as part of the registration. That letters/numbers are impossible to read. On several of our attempts, we were certain we had the code correctly deciphered, only to have the information we had already typed in erased and prompted to re enter the user name, password, and code AGAIN.After a couple frustrating hours we gave up. The option to change the code until you get one that is more easily understood is not an option when registering this device. There is no explication of why the attempt to register was denied. And you are forced to re-enter almost all of the information EVERY SINGLE TIME.In conclusion: I purchased a gift on Father's day that he still cannot use on July 1st.. I am not pleased with this purchase."
"2651","I don't read a lot but when I do it's usually on vacation when I don't want to carry a book around with me. The Kindle is perfect for me!! I also use it every morning for devotions and now don't have to use my bible."
"2652","I really enjoy my Kindle reader and I know that I'm going to be very happy to have it when I am travelling.  It is very easy to use and easy to download books from the library or others that I have purchased."
"2653","Excellent!"
"2654","Love it!!!"
"2655","This is a device that demonstrates regression. This is very portable, better at being glare free than other Kindles of its type and is fast at the things it does. Some things must be clearly noted: 1) There is no internal illumination and it can be read ONLY with external .light; 2) there is no audio and no jack for audio. At the special price of $59 with adverts it is probably overpriced anywhere from $10 to $20. I don't recall the description well but the features it was lacking came as sort of a surprise and I felt they should have been mentioned more prominently. Otherwise it operates well as a cheap reader."
"2656","I got this basic Kindle after my first Kindle froze and 1/3 of the screen got the dreaded lines throughout.  Apparently this is a fairly typical issue and if you are past your warranty there is nothing they can do to help you.  Anyhow, I got this newer version of the base Kindle and while it does the job, I don't care for the page buttons nearly as much as the older model.  I much preferred the buttons on the side of the screen that you used to turn pages....now I often accidentally tap in the screen and the pages start moving.  Either way, I still enjoy how slim and light the Kindle is...it makes it much easier to read why standing and riding the bus or while traveling."
"2657","I received this as a gift for Christmas present. This It's the first kindle I've owned. Very simple but it's perfect for reading. Very light and easy to use. You can have books you want to read in a click of a button!"
"2658","This appears to be a very inexpensive small tablet. It was all that was advertised though I wish it had the interior light that allows one to read without a lamp. The size is good and its availability on WIFI has been very good."
"2659","Very nice."
"2660","Five *****"
"2661","I really like the adjustable font size and style and the non-glare screen allowing me to read outside under a tree. Downloads really do take only seconds. The free and low cost selection of books, mags and papers is great.  I like being able to write notes and highlights and look up definitions. It's just the way I like it! Thanks!"
"2662","its awesome, but i wouldn't say perfect.all items have their flaws, but it gives me what i need. its slow, yes, but when you read you don't have much room for impatience. so be calm and collected with this device.it supplies my reading desires, and that's all i was asking for."
"2663","Not very happy with this for a handheld reader all you have to do is brush it and it starts turning pages the bad part is sometimes it changes five or six pages and you have a problem finding your place again"
"2664","My daughters were thrilled with their kindles since both are avid readers. They loved the functionality of the kindle and both said it was the perfect gift.  A+ for me!  Thanks Amazon for making it affordable."
"2665","Love it!!!"
"2666","Yes its small and light..text size changes often ,pages do not turn easy sometimes you need to add pressure.if your thumb is overlapping the edge it goes back a page.I TRULY WANT SIDE BUTTONS BACK!!!!!!"
"2667","I love it!"
"2668","Love it!!!"
"2669","I love it."
"2670","It is not easy to connect to Amazon or to overdrive.  On overdrive, it does not down load the book cover when searching for several books on a page.  When I finally get a book downloaded it is ok.  Have to go to laptop to return to library can not do in easy step from kindle"
"2671","It's so bad for the arabic support because there's no arabic Book on store!!I'm don't recommend any one how's want to use it for arabic book..Amazon store is poor and not update for Arabic book.."
"2672","I haven't had much previous experience with Kindles in the past. That being said, this is everything I could have asked for in an e-reader. The E-Ink is easy to read and doesn't give me a headache after long periods of time like my phone screen did. All in all it was well worth the purchase. If you're on the fence about buying one, make the jump and buy it! You won't be sorry!"
"2673","Absolutely outstanding. I got this during the PRIME Day special, but I would not hesitate to pay full price for one of these. It is compact and it fits in the large cargo pocket in my cargo shorts. No glare when reading at the pool and much easier on the eyes than reading on a tablet."
"2674","Tbh there is not much to review... It does as advertised and very simple to use. What I will review is how quick they were able to get it shipped to a fpo ap box, and how they already associated the Sn with my account so I didn't have to sync anything. As usual Amazon comes through very impressed as always."
"2675","I love it!"
"2676","Wonderful!"
"2677","Been reluctant to use a kindle however, I wish it had been around 20 years ago.  Merely have to look up titles and order the book, immediately at your fingertips.  Carry all your books in a small package.  Couldn""t be happier.It's like magic"
"2678","Everything it was promised to be. It's very light and the 6 inch may be small for some but for a general use it gets the job done. I have all my textbooks on the kindle and it makes it significantly easier to do school work. The touch screen is responsive and battery has lasted me 2 weeks so far and still have roughly 50% with moderate use. Bit of a fingerprint magnet if that bothers you but nothing a sleeve of a shirt can't fix. I suggest purchasing the kindle if you are in the market for an Ereader"
"2679","Wonderful!"
"2680","I love reading more than anything and I am truly happy with my Kindle. Except for the ""glitches"" on the screen, I am extremely satisfied plus I got this for 49$! I just regret registering it as the offers started appearing at the bottom of the screen."
"2681","I love it."
"2682","This Kindle is only so so, still better than earlier versions. The reading surface is a little dim as compared to the Kindle paper white or Kindle HDX. I bought it thinking it would be a carrying along e-reader for me. Spend a little more money and buy the Kindle paperwhite and you will not regret. Don't waste your money on this gadget. With today's technology, you would expect something better. I give a 3 stars because of the price."
"2683","I considered this to be a waste of money. Yes, I knew it didn't have a backlit screen when I bought it. However, that was irrelevant. In a well lit room the screen was still too dark to read. It is nothing like reading a printed book."
"2684","The only reason I buy it is because this is the only device let kids read books only without any temptation to play games.The digital ink looks good, however, every time you flip a page, the screen flashes a little. I found it really annoying and wonder if this will do some harm to the vision health."
"2685","Another awesome Amazon product.What's to say?  This is an awesome reading tool and I recommend them.This particular model is lightweight and very easy to use.I purchased this for my mother for a Christmas gift and she loves it.  It stores a ton of books, the set up was easy and it is the perfect size.If I could make a change it would be that ALL Kindles were in color.  Even the ones that only operate as an e-reader.  I like to read a lot of true-crime books, biographies and educational materials and most of these have pictures.  I just wish they were in color on all Kindles."
"2686","I absolutely LOVE my Kindle!!!!!  I always made fun of people who had one as I love reading ""real"" books. But, since I've had my Kindle, the no-glare, non-backlit screen doesn't hurt my eyes and makes it super easy to lounge around and read. I've had it for less than a week and have already read two entire books (my normal yearly average)!!!!"
"2687","Awesome :)"
"2688","I love it!"
"2689","I love it!"
"2690","Love It!!!"
"2691","Great Product. Language was French. Had to get on line to determine how to change the language so I could operate the devise. Other than that happy with the thing. Great feature in that I can down load all of the books we have already purchased to this devise."
"2692","Eh. I like it. I just dont love it. It is slightly smaller than I thought, and its just a bit slick, which makes holding it when you're laying on your side difficult. The screen is at times sensitive and then on responsive. The screen is also incredibly delicate and after three days of reading I have significant scratches. Crumbs will scratch this screen. Do not swipe a crumb away, as it will scratch. I have already ordered the screen protector. In the age of cell phone screens that are much more durable, it was hard to imagine why this screen is so incredibly delicate."
"2693","The long battery life and light weight to carry makes Kindle 6"" a great thing for reading especially without all the distractions on the regular tablets.  I got it during Thanksgiving sale and it's a great deal.  Really like it!If you have a smartphone and like to read books.  I feel this is better choice than a tablet. Just my opinion."
"2694","Excellent!"
"2695","quite good"
"2696","I'm Soooo happy with my Kindle. This is my second kindle. I also own the Kindle 3G with keyboard. I wanted this smaller version for work. Love the touch screen and its so light even with the case I purchased."
"2697","I've been waiting for years to buy a kindle or a nook. Kindle won!! The only thing I had a problem with was how to ""Return"" the books back from the Kindle. Now, I know what to do. So far, I like it very much."
"2698","I love it the glare free is awesome I use it when waiting on my kids at school and the tablet I used to use couldn't even read in the sun and I was tired of caring around a bunch of paper backs I love my new kindle!!"
"2699","fantastic product, small, lightweight, and really easy to use. the only draw back i would have to say would be the lack of a back light, but having moderate light you should be fine. overall for the price, this kindle is a steal."
"2700","Light, easy to use and seems well put together.  I use it more everyday and now I am starting to use it to check out library books also.  It was a father's day present from my wife and I will really use it."
"2701","I love it!"
"2702","It's good."
"2703","Excellent!"
"2704","The small size of this Kindle is my biggest gripe. I'm a fast reader, so I'm always tapping to advance the page and continue.  For the price, its a great backup to my two DX Kindles, which are both starting to go. It was a spontaneous buy on ""Amazon Day"" and so far I haven't had to recharge it. Not as easy to navigate as the DX, more difficult to hold without mistakenly paging ahead. I'll keep it, but I think this one may have been a mistake."
"2705","I have had 2 Kindles and LOVE LOVE LOVE my kindle. I don't leave the house without it. It's light, compact, and fits in my purse.  I load up a few books on it for vacation and don't need to bring  a charger since I fully charged it before I left. I love that it tells me when I am trying to buy a book I've already bought, very helpful. I highly recommend the kindle!"
"2706","I bought this replacement kindle after I lost my first generation kindle. the touchscreen is a little too sensitive for me. if i accidentally touch the screen (which seems to be every ten seconds), the font changes, or will try to highligh phrases, etc etc. So annoying! I miss the old school non-touch screen kindle. actually this new kindle is a tad bit heavier than my old one! about 0.6 ounces I think, which doesn't seem like much but my wrists can tell the difference, when i'm lying in bed and holding it up to read.That being said, i love kindle--being able to hold thousands of books in this 6-7 ounce reader, battery life that lasts about a month."
"2707","I didn't have high hopes for my kindle, as I cannot look at a screen long. I saw that they were 50 bucks for black Friday so I got one and cannot be happier. I now have hundreds of books on my kindle."
"2708","I bought this Kindle for my wife because she's a big time reader and I wanted to save space in our apartment. Not only a great space saving idea but she loves the way it works as well as the battery life. The only thing is I should have gone for the 3g service."
"2709","works good"
"2710","i love it!"
"2711","I love it."
"2712","Love this thing, even after swearing up and down that I'd never buy an ereader. The screen is so similar to looking at a page in a book that I forget sometimes I'm not. Battery lasts for ages and I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to get one. Must have for any avid reader."
"2713","VERR GOOD!"
"2714","I like it!"
"2715","Thank you."
"2716","Love it!!!"
"2717","Everything"
"2718","I just read a review that it can't be used at the beach!  That's the only place i use this device BECAUSE IT IS PERFECT FOR READING AT THE BEACH!  It is my favirite place to read and ONLY the kindke white works there.  I don't know what that girl is doing wrong, but this is a great device for ANYWHERE you want to read!"
"2719","A great purchase.  I'm not a big reader, but love books.  I find that the Kindle allows me to read faster and not be intimidated by large book.  Great screen quality and I love the ability to define a word instantly while I'm reading."
"2720","I bought a kindle a few years ago. I had cause to complain about the web browser. Whenever I downloaded my local newspaper and press article mode it keeps downloading over and over. Recently, when the menu button is depressed, it will take a frustratingly long time to appear. reading books on it was almost perfect.. Believing the machine was defective I bought a new improved model which promised touch screen facility, improved dynamics, and most of all an IMPROVED WEB BROWSER. Boy, was I disappointed! This machine is far worse than the old one when it comes to web browsing  Imagine, the bookmarks that were downloaded with it from the Manufacturers simply don't work.It keeps blinking and downloading over and over. options in the menu button takes quite a while to appear many times. However, once again the reading books is quite a pleasure. When it comes to reading a book or a down loaded article it works quite well. I bought this machine so that I can down load my local news papers to read. I am aware of charges to be incurred for certain sights, my comparison lies with my computer and tablet where I get most of the important news. some companies give a synopsis of certain articles and you are asked to sign in to read more. In case of the E reader,  I am regularly getting the message Application Error, Try Again. If I try again the same message comes up. These pages will download perfectly in any of my computers or tablet."
"2721","DO NOT BY A KINDLE TOUCH.  It is the most dreadful eReader you could possibly own.  Nothing on it works properly.  Page turning sucks.  Paging thru your titles sucks (it opens books wile trying to turn pages).  The entire touch interface is glaringly flawed,I WILL NO LONGER BUY KINDLE PRODUCTS!  I will be using Calibre to convert all my titles to EPUB and move away from Kindle!"
"2722","Bigger and heavier than the old generation.  The touchscreen isn't worth the additional weight and bulk.  No longer light enough to leave in a purse without adding noticeable weight."
"2723","I received this kindle as a gift a while back and use it on a daily basis. I like it better than the more expensive kindles because it does not have a back-light and does not make my eyes tired. It is ergonomically designed and has an extremely long battery life if you disable the wifi. The storage space is much more than anyone can ever need."
"2724","Even though the Kindle Paperwhite has been touted as the preferred Kindle for those of us who just want to use  it for reading, I think my 6"" Glare-Free one just fine.  Excellent choice for me!"
"2725","Absolute best device to read a book. Have had a nook and used both an iPad and iPad mini and this is the best of all of them. With the sweet deals on books from Amazon this is the best deal around."
"2726","I love having my books on one small device instead of tripping over mountains of them. I also love that the screen is glare-free and that I can adjust the size of the type, making it easy to read."
"2727","definitely a great device. does what what it needs to do very well. one thing ive noticed is on certain cites (gmail) it wont let me scroll down in the inbox. it also randomly closes out of cites on the internet but will open them back up when you get back on. it supports Wi-Fi just fine so im assuming this is just because it is ment more as an e-reader than an all purpose tablet. over all its a great product and does what it needs to do very well"
"2728","I love Kindle's and have purchased some of each of them (Kindle, Fire, Paperwhite) as gifts. I was very disappointed that this one did not have the ability to listen to my audio books. My previous regular Kindle had this ability and nothing was mentioned about the audio no longer being available. Quiet disappointing. Amazon often offers the ability to purchase the Audible version of the book which can be synced. No idea why this is offered but can't be used with anything other than the Kindle Fire which I do not prefer to use for reading."
"2729","Easy to use"
"2730","It is a disappointment! Despite buying the case, it doesn't stand so you have to hold it like a book.  Okay, that's not so bad. My biggest problem is that it is not in sync with my other kindle.  That is, if I read on one the other doesn't respond and keep pace. So I could be on chapter two on one kindle  but only on chapter one on my new kindle. This doesn't work for me since I share my third kindle with my husband. He plays games and checks face book.I'm sorry I bought it."
"2731","there is no way an average person can figure out how to use the Kindle.  What happened to easy Kindle?  I'm trying to find an old version that a 3rd grader could program.  Do you have any of the original version left, where you push buttons to turn a page, find your books, etc.  I can't even bring up the books I bought on the old system.  I'm stuck in the middle of a boring book. HELP"
"2732","The absence of directions on how to start using the Kindle was really frustrating.  In addition, even going to Amazon.com's website on ordering free books for the Kindle was frustrating: when asking for the device used, it did not offer the choice of different Kindles or describe how to transfer book content to the Kindle adequately."
"2733","Good stuff."
"2734","really good"
"2735","Love it...."
"2736","Really good"
"2737","My husband and I were each given one for Christmas.  We're older and only slightly into electronic devices and were dubious at first.  However, this Kindle is so easy to use and has wonderful features.  It's easy to order new Kindle books and light-weight enough to easily hold up to read in bed.  We're hooked now."
"2738","Great device. Battery is fantastic. It is small and light weight and perfect for reading outside. What do not like though is every time I accidentally touch the page, something happens like the menu pops up or I accidentally turn the page, kinda annoying."
"2739","Exceeds expectations.  Having a general preference for books over computer screens, I like the black-and-white, reflect-only screen.  It is far easier to read than a light-up screen.  Also, the capabilities of the device are beyond what I had expected.  The dictionary/Wikipedia function is particularly useful. I actually prefer this device to those that are much more expensive."
"2740","It is great"
"2741","Excellent!!"
"2742","I loved it."
"2743","Easy to use"
"2744","Excellent!!"
"2745","I got the Amazon Kindle for Christmas from my daughter.  I love the lightweight feel to it and how easy it is to manuever and view books.  Love the fact that you can review a book before purchasing.  I've always loved having a paperback in my hands but this has turned my reading into a whole new level."
"2746","Love it !!!"
"2747","I loved it."
"2748","Good device"
"2749","Fantastic product that brought me back into the e-reader fold. I use it everyday on my commute to work: It's light and I can hold it in one hand, so it's really easy to keep reading in a packed subway."
"2750","Great ereader if that is all an individual wants, but personally I just wish I would have opted to spend a little more and purchase the color display Kindle in the beginning. I did end up purchasing the color unit also."
"2751","I am disappointed that my previously puchased and read books do not appear in the appropriate created collections. My previous Kindle packed up, so it is most frustrating.  It is slightly too thick and heavy, but I like the one touch page turn - a big improvement.  Overall a much better Kindle."
"2752","Love it !!!"
"2753","Excellent!!"
"2754","it's great!"
"2755","Fantastic!!"
"2756","As expected"
"2757","Yes, we love it.  It was a gift... and our first Kindle. Something we will be able to easily port around. Downloads are easy and incredibly fast; set-up was super easy. Like the touch screen and dictionary look-up. The nonglare screen suits our needs best. Think the other reviews cover the rest!"
"2758","It works like I expected. Hard to read in low light but I guess that's what Paperwhite is for; I didn't want to spend extra as I bought it for vacation reading. Overall, I like it fine; its lightweight and fits in my small purse."
"2759","I have always been a Nook or iPad book reader...but this device is just amazing!!! Love how light it is and thin.  I can finally read outside with no problem and it holds a charge forever.  Perfect device for the right price! Love it!!!"
"2760","Works great"
"2761","woeks great"
"2762","Good price!"
"2763","Nice reader at a nice price, but needs better accessories, such as a cover with a light built in.  Kindle Touch was a superior, better built device, but was more expensive.  It had much superior accessories though.  Should have looked for a decent case with light before I jumped on it, but at the $49 Christmas price, it was tough to pass on it."
"2764","Works very well as expected.  Would like to be able to read it in the dark and I believe that is available on some Kindles.  We have a couple of Kindle Fires but prefer the lighter versions just for reading. The original Kindle let me buy and download books from anywhere.  I even sent one to my son who was on a ship in Japan and he could buy books from there.  Now, I have to be near my router to download a book."
"2765","Ive had this kindle for a long time but that should help with knowing the depedability. i still use it to read my favorite books. Especially on long trips. I went to bahamas in nuly and took it with me on a 4 hr plane ride."
"2766","Hate this Kindle (this is my fifth Kindle).  Purchased for my grandson for Christmas as a ""deal of the day"" back on Black Friday.  Didn't notice that you can't change the brightness at all, so every book is the same dull screen brightness.  I know I should have read the specs better, but still, Amazon needs to be more clear about how this works.  I just noticed it as I was trying to set it up to give him tonight for Christmas.  I'll give it to him tonight, but will be returning it for a better model.  This is truly entry level and there is virtually no reason anyone should ever buy this model.  Stick with your phone, iPad, or spend a few more dollars to get the paper white.  This model is like your first car in high school.  Hate, hate, hate it!!"
"2767","works great"
"2768","Easy to use"
"2769","It's great!"
"2770","easy to use"
"2771","Great item."
"2772","nice device"
"2773","nice kindle"
"2774","When I bought this Kindle, I was unaware that there were so many different kinds all with different features.  Even though I like the glare free screen, I would have liked to have it also be back lit so that I could read at night while my husband is trying to sleep!"
"2775","It is light weight and glare free. Touch friendly with quick response and adequate choices for fonts. Downloads are easy and fast. I love my kindle. Now I just need to get my family to stop stealing it."
"2776","It's great, but I bought it as a gift for my husband and now cannot remove my name from it. On his own Kindle, he is known as a user only. There must have been some step I missed when I was purchasing it, but not being too computer saavy, I apparently missed it. It's a bit annoying. He is up and reading now, after some effort, so I guess all is well in the end."
"2777","Perfection!"
"2778","As expected"
"2779","Works great"
"2780","Very disappointed that this 6"" kindle has no back lighting for reading in bed in the dark. Had I known this fact before purchase, I would never bought it. To date, all my Amazon purchases have been exactly as advertised but this one is not."
"2781","I am not that familiar with a Kindle products, and this is not what I thought it would be. We purchased it as a gift for an older person, and it is too small and difficult for her to operate. I am also not pleased that my account was automatically loaded on it, so I would be charged for anything she purchased. We plan to return it, but would like to delete my account information from it before doing so. Please advise us how to do this."
"2782","My old kindle broke and I needed a new one. The interface is nice, touch controls are intuitive, and the battery life holds up to expectations. the screen is just as visible as the old keyboard model that broke on me."
"2783","enjoy the compact size and long lasting battery."
"2784","Girlfriend loves it.  That's good enough for me."
"2785","the software is inferior to the old kindle unit.  too many stupid options and over complicated.  obviously designed by a non reader who has no idea of how book readers read."
"2786","no more searching for over priced books in dubai's massive bookstores instead i purchased the over priced kindle they sell at the virgin megastore . Still quite happy with the purchase. Please send me a nice leather cover for it Amazon as I can't afford it anymore.:)"
"2787","I really liike this kindle. Especially the dictionary is awesome and very convenient. The technology is amazing!!!It was delivered to me quickly as well. Thanks Amazaon!:)"
"2788","Bought this for two relatives for Christmas and they love it.  It is amazing all the free books that you can download from the local library right to this kindle.  It reads just like a book, only better and for $59, you can't beat the price. Very pleased with this purchase!"
"2789","good for use"
"2790","Nice product"
"2791","Great kindle"
"2792","Awesome item"
"2793","Very happy with the new kindle. But the reason I had to get it is that my old kindle died after just 2 years. The screen developed a blank bar of about 5 lines of text. This time I have also purchased for $20 the 2 year replacement plan. I am pretty disappointed that the original didn't last longer. Thee laptop I am writing this review on is almost 10 years od. Well done Dell."
"2794","The Kindle is my favorite gadget I've ever purchased. It has replaced paper books for me, and I recommend it to everyone I meet. I can't say anything more; it's the best."
"2795","Really miss the page forward and back buttons on the sides of the frame.  The touch screen for page turning makes it more difficult to have a seamless reading experience."
"2796","ok,i love it"
"2797","I prefer a non glare screen for reading, particularly on the beach. this kindle does just that! It is a very simple Kindle, but fits conveniently into a purse, beach bag, or any other carrying bag.it is great for travel and the battery life is amazing!"
"2798","Nice product"
"2799","Good product"
"2800","Though not unhappy with this new Kindle, I don't appreciate having to look at their ads every time I go to turn it on.  If there is a way to turn this off I would love to know.  I'm going to order a cover so I'm not bombarded with whatever Amazon wants to sell me when I look at it."
"2801","Good so far."
"2802","This replaces an older Kindle. The new user interface is very nice. I have yet to learn the new document organization on the device. I cannot create collections on it directly. The only organization seems to be in the cloud."
"2803","The device felt cheap to me. I have an original kindle that I love and it still works well. But they had a deal on this so I thought I might upgrade. However i just wasn't thrilled with it. I also had spotty wi fi reception where my original worked just fine.Amazon was great as usual about the return. It just wasn't for me. Maybe the higher version is better, I just would not recommend this particular one."
"2804","Works great."
"2805","I'm just so frustrated that they decided to put neither speakers nor a headphone jack in this thing.  The whole device is absolutely incredible.  So, so, so nice.  And then, seemingly for no reason, they make this incredibly stupid decision to purposefully strip it of any audio capabilities.  So much for audible and Kindle Narration being compatible with your own company's device!"
"2806","Like being able to touch page to move on. Do not like having all the other things (highlights,etc) that I never use suddenly appear on the page if I move the Kindle wrong or accidentally brush it.  Would much prefer prefer such things at the top of the page with buy and home, etc. to tap. Like the lighted page, though. All in all I prefer the way my old Kindle works."
"2807","Love my new Kindle.  I got it for Christmas and downloaded my first book right away.  Finished it in a week.  Love the super light nature of the device and ability to adjust the font size too.  Can't wait to read my next book."
"2808","great device"
"2809","The Kindle ghosts alot - when you turn a page, you can still see the page before it like a carbon print. I've called tech support and that's ""normal"" for this version. It's face is smaller than I expected as well, but on the flip side, fits in a purse nicely."
"2810","I like the size, but not the touchscreen. I have to be careful to hold it at the edges or I accidentally advance the page. I couldn't find a non-touch screen in my price range. I'm having trouble getting my books organized into collections. My previous Kindle was organized by collections, but I don't know how to transfer that organization to this new Kindle, so I've been doing it manually from the cloud. It's cumbersome. My previous Kindle stopped working. It would continuously reboot itself about every 10 minutes, which is why I got this one. The screen is non-glare. Overall, I like it and would recommend it."
"2811","Very confusing to start up - had to have someone else get it going and then I was finally able to finish the process. Now everything is great, I enjoy reading from it and think it will really come in handy during trips - so many great books to read and now it is easy to use, too."
"2812","This was very hard to get set up.  It would be good if the guide book would be in print so you could look at as you go instead of it all being online.It took several attempts to get everything going.  Almost asked to send it back.  But now we have it set up and it is working."
"2813","Refurbished KindleLooked brand new.Tried to update and register the computer. Do not know what generation it is (question asked for me to update and register the  computer).Do not like touch screens, will have to get used to them."
"2814","I really like this. The only thing I would say that is the slightest bit annoying is the lag the screen sometimes has, however, I know this is a function of the technology as a whole and is not a fault of the design itself."
"2815","Love love it"
"2816","I like the 6"" Kindle very much; it was a great price.  However, I think in the future I would upgrade to a lighted screen, and wish I had realized how much versatility it would mean to have it when I bought the 6"".  All in all, it is a wonderful additional reading device."
"2817","Works Great!"
"2818","Am going to return it for a kindle paperwhite.  If you want to save the $50 that's fine, but in the long run you'll get a lot more use out of a kindle that has a light in it.  First thing my wife said the second day she had it was ""can i read in the dark on this?"" It hasn't been used since.So i'd have to say that the kindle itself is of great quality and it does what's advertised,  but as for user friendliness I just don't see what a kindle without a light will do for most consumers as i'd assume most people want to read in bed."
"2819","He loves it!"
"2820","Shipped fast"
"2821","I find it difficult to read. Very dull even in good light. I would not have purchased it if it had not been such a good deal. But even so, I will not be using it very often... Maybe when I travel. VERY disappointed."
"2822","Yeah kindle!"
"2823","It's awesome"
"2824","This is my second kindle.  My first one wore out after much use.  This one is great.  The touch screen is very touchy bit I think after I use it more it will be easier.  If you are just reading with your kindle this is a good one."
"2825","I love this kindle! so easy to throw in my purse for a long car ride or for use at home! I love the fact that you can still read the screen easily while out in the sunlight. Can't do that with all e-readers!"
"2826","It is simply a fantastic machine. It allows me to read for very long hours because  of the larger text size options. I am very happy with this kindle, it is both easy to use and fun to read on. I will buy buying one for my whole family very soon."
"2827","I am enjoying the Kindle.  I'm still learning how to navigate the books and controls,  but I am very happy that the Kindle is so light and that I can enlarge the font.  Looking forward to reading future Ken Follet and George R.R. Martin books on it.  I hope to link to the public library when I am more proficient."
"2828","Great tablet"
"2829","as described"
"2830","I. Love. It!"
"2831","gave as gift"
"2832","I love my new Kindle. Have always loved reading and this is so much more handy than lugging a book or books around. I can read a book a day so if I had to travel, it was either pack more books or purchase them wherever I went (which was too expensive). Kindle is the solution to any reader's dilemma!! Love it!!"
"2833","It's awesome"
"2834","A real nice Kindle...has more features than I expected...I'm enjoying using it...This is the third refurb I've bought for our family...we all enjoy them..."
"2835","I love this kindle. It's super easy to navigate and its size is ideal for those who like to carry ereaders in their purse like I do. I had gotten one for my mom and instantly wanted one for my own. :) It's perfect!!"
"2836","I didn't realize there was no backlight, which means it can't be used in a darker room.  That makes it similar to a book, but i don't recall ever reading that in the product description.  fortunately Amazon took it back with no problems."
"2837","Love it!!! is small light easy to read and the touch works for what it is meant for. Turning pages is easy and confortable. Scrolling potential books is not so smooth with the touch but is easy to get use to it. Overall is a great product."
"2838","Great device"
"2839","Works great."
"2840","Works great."
"2841","Very pleased"
"2842","Great device"
"2843","I love this Kindle!  It is exactly what I want - no frills - just for reading - fits perfectly in one hand.  I have my Amazon/Kindle account hooked up with my local library so I can check out books and save some $$$."
"2844","The classic keyboard kindle was their best device by far. Touch screens are terrible for reading books, one accidental touch of the screen and you've turned the page. It was so annoying I sent it back and bought a used keyboard one off eBay. It would be great if they would, at a minimum bring back the buttons on the sides for page turning, and allow you to disable the touch screen when reading."
"2845","great device"
"2846","Kindle perfect for reading, very light and handy.!!! i love it. Though I couldn't find in the user's guide, if it ever turns off or something. It seems it just has ""screen off mode"" does't it mean it's always working and consuming battery?..  besides this ! it'svery nice. I would recommend it."
"2847","I have the 2nd generation Kindle's with the keyboard, 3G, and have been using it for over 3 years. I love it. I don't know what I ever did without it.Fast forward. I have two young boys who are both avid readers, and so for Christmas I bought them the most basic Kindle possible.Battery life is horrible. For my boys, after 3-4 hours of reading over 3 days, they have to recharge. This is after wif-fi being disconnected (if that makes any difference with these Kindle's which I'm beginning to think it doesn't...sigh). The original Kindle's will last weeks on a single charge as long as there is no wi-fi connected. I love this for long plane rides, which my family often endures.  Amazon took what had to be the most simple user experience for someone that just wants to be able to read books, without having to store all those paper books in their home, and made it the most complicated little machine to do so. It has so many ""extras"" that link back to Amazon in some way, mostly to purchase books or join programs (this is not including ""ads"" which are just junk and I would strongly suggest removing from the device if you haven't already done so, you can do this after you buy them for  20 extra dollars). I get that, Amazon wants to make money and make the device seem ""in tune"" with the user. Over time these features may prove to be useful, and with time it will become easier to navigate through the rabbit hole that is the ""Settings"" area but for now, it's just an overly complex system to have someone download and read a book. I truly wish Amazon would come out with something with no extras, no free time, no google reads, no books suggestions, no experimental browser....just a device for downloading and reading books, (more like the original Kindle) and continue to support it. Not everyone wants touch screen and multiple options and ""features"" at the cost of efficiency and simplicity."
"2848","Great reader"
"2849","what a $save"
"2850","Love it ...."
"2851","Works great!"
"2852","I struggled to figure how to open and manage the kindle. Finally on my third try a very nice lady helped me to find the instructions and make the thing work. There were no instructions with the kindle. couldn't get in. Very  confusing. all seems to be well now."
"2853","I had to replace my Kindle Fire because of problems with the charger cord and plug-in receptacle.  The Fire and this e-reader do not operate the same way and I am having trouble finding different screens and navigating.among them.  Why not a short intro to using the paperwhite, without having to download a whole manual?Also, the hard cover I got strictly for the new reader does not fit it properly."
"2854","I assumed the 6"" meant the size of the screen not the entire kindle.  Was disappointed to find  the reading area so small.  I also don't like that there is no backlight.  You can only read if you are in a lighted room...no late night reads without waking anyone up.  I do like the ease of enlarging the print and turning the page with just a tap of the finger instead of a swipe."
"2855","I'm soooooo Happy I bought this for myself! I love it"
"2856","would like to have ability to adjust screen lighting."
"2857","The kindel touch is the best e reader in the world I owned a nook then got a kindel I got it just a week ago already read two books I was so amazed I am thinking about buying the paper white this is a must buy I will buy only Amazon elictronics now"
"2858","The kindle is great once you get it set up.  It took numerous phone calls to get rid of the ads that pop up.  Old people don't need those confusing things.  The gift card was hard to get customer service to set up instead of a credit card.  The kindle after finally getting it set up is great!"
"2859","Perfection!!"
"2860","Love it! It does. Exactly what I wanted the screen is awesome and so easy to read. The battery is phenomenal I haven't charged it in a week and have read heavy for 5 of those days and I'm only at half battery. I would recommend this to anyone."
"2861","I used to have buggy book lay around living room, I wish I had this device before. Its save me a lot of space. Very good screen just like ready magazine, book, or newspaper. I put so many book in this reader, battery amazing last for weeks you dont have to turn it off."
"2862","Great device!"
"2863","Great for light or heavy reading. Battery lasts for weeks at a time, and the screen is crystal clear. I could not recommend this product enough."
"2864","I am still waiting on an order: janetowens290 @gmail.com"
"2865","Terrible customer service Amazon! I purchased 3 kindles on Black Friday for three of my kids for Christmas. On Christmas morning one of the touchscreens did not work. We tried trouble shooting and nothing worked. After a month of attempting to contact Amazon to get a replacement I was sent a REFURBISHED kindle. I purchased a brand new (defective) kindle and after a month of begging was sent a refurbished kindle to replace it."
"2866","I have not really got to use it a lot. But since this is a Christmas present from Santa to my 7 year old, the first thing I was asked to do is to put the ""active contents"" on, e.g. crossword games and chess games. But to my frustration, I didn't get to complete the task in 5 mintues. The research that followed told me that this version does not support ""active contents"" which really puzzled me. Why??? Crossword and chess are really educational and good for a break from reading, I would think. I simply don't understand why this functionality is taken away. Now I ended up giving my paperwhite to my kid and I'm taking over this inferior product. Not happy at all! If it were not from Santa, I would definitely have returned it!"
"2867","Like its clarity, handleability: the touchscreen is improvement over the side controls. Perfect for reading by the pool in the Florida sun.Need a good cover now, didn't like the Amazon cover I tried."
"2868","I think this will work great for my 75 year old mother-in-law.  Quite an upgrade from my 1st Edition Kindle, she keeps borrowing from me, but it should be easy for her to figure out.  Hope it is harder for her to accidentally delete the book she is reading, especially before she finishes it."
"2869","I love the Kindle. I was worried that I would miss the aspect of reading a ""real book"" but I don't. The Kindle is much more convenient. I got more than I could have hoped for. I highly recommend it!"
"2870","Only complaint is the lack of free classics.s available for download, I know there are great deals but I previously owned a Kobo reader abdominal enjoyed the 100 free classics. Otherwise a Great reader."
"2871","i love it! :)"
"2872","Its been a week of use, and I am pretty impressed with the device so far.. Its pretty responsive, and transferring files is so easy as well..Except for the light like the Paperwhite, this device is perfect for reading.. I would like Amazon to consider screen rotation as a future update though."
"2873","it's really comfortable looking at the screen, much better than pads. And I like the dictionary feature. Just click on a word, and it pops up a window of the word's meaning and wiki. Purchasing books is also fast and convenient. Good product."
"2874","I love the kindle 7th generation. It is easy to navigate with the touchscreen, lightweight and easy on the eyes. The only e-reader for me."
"2875","Great Product"
"2876","Easy to read."
"2877","Great reading"
"2878","Great product"
"2879","Great product"
"2880","At first I was frustrated that the only exterior control was the on/off button, but once I became familiar with the function, I love it. It was given as a birthday gift to our 11 year old grandson. He was off an running instantly with it and all excited to read what I had downloaded for him."
"2881","The Kindle was as expected and stated in promotion.  Delivery was right on schedule - good job.  Doesn't have a backlight, my fault, did not read carefully.  Miss that one.  Still pleased with this basic e reader and its features."
"2882","I had one of the original kindles. I love the size, the swipe to turn pages and the ease of using the menue. It is small enough to put in my purse. My other kindle has been passed on to my husband to use for many more years."
"2883","Perfect size!"
"2884","Great product"
"2885","nice and easy"
"2886","Great reader!"
"2887","The amazon consumer service is so good... they give me the guaranty and security of me shipping... It took time but Finally i could get me Kindle...and the assistance with kindle products is amazing to.Thank you amazon group."
"2888","Love the compact natrure and the fact its good to use during the day (due to no back light), but little frustrated that we need to use a light for night time reading like an ordinary book.  A little pop out light,like a laptap keyboard light, would make a bunch of sense."
"2889","I love this kindle, but I wish it had a back light because I cant read in the dark unless I buy a light.. Not that big of a deal to buy one, but I wish that is on thing that was included... Other than that I love it!!! It much a lot easier on the eyes than my iphone."
"2890","This thing does what it says. Very lightweight and so far no complaints about it! Bought 2 for my partner and myself, hopefully many months of happy reading ahead. Great purchase and will recommend to family and friends! Lovin' it!"
"2891","Great product"
"2892","Great Item!!!"
"2893","a good reader"
"2894","good e-reader"
"2895","Great reader."
"2896","I do like the Kindle, 6"" Glare-Free touchscreen but since it does not have a built in light its hard to read after dusk unless you have a bright light on. I do wish it had the ability to use apps but other than that I love it and i'm constantly reading on it."
"2897","My question is: Why did it take 5 days for shipment?  The guaranteed delivery date was Saturday, March 7 and it finally arrived Tuesday, March 10!  Other than a problem with delivery this was a great buy and was a gift that was very much appreciated."
"2898","Bought it to give to my mother as a gift.  I have the Kindle Fire, but this does not work the same way.  I had a hard time trying to get back to the home page.  Also, very sensitive to touch, causing it to change pages before you are ready.  It works ok, but I would not buy another one."
"2899","Easy to use. Looks just like a book, which is why I love it!. It also holds a really long charge, which is ideal because I read for hours on end. i would reccomend buying a book light for it if you like to read at night!"
"2900","I bought this Kindle to replace my second generation kindle that met its demise at the mouth of my puppy. It did not disappoint. It took a bit to get used to the touch screen feature, but I love it now."
"2901","Love it! Duh!"
"2902","Works perfect"
"2903","Great product"
"2904","As described!"
"2905","Very lightweight. Working great so far. The send-to-kindle app is perfect for converting and sending pdfs in the kindle format."
"2906","I love my new Kindle but have been having trouble finding a cover with a light that will fit it. I ordered one and had to return it because the light did not work. Otherwise I am very happy with the Kindle."
"2907","Very clear writing,  much better then the kindle 3rd generation we had.  Fast download of now books and syncs much faster then the old kindle as well. But oddly it is heavier then the old kindle,  but that could be because of the fact it is touchscreen."
"2908","I am having problems with charging my Kindle fire and cannot find ANY help from Amazon on what to do or where to go.There should be some where that I can get info on what or where to go to have this problem corrected and that should come from Amazon!"
"2909","Great Product"
"2910","I've owned over half a dozen Kindles.  When I opened this Kindle, I was shocked to discover1. My Audible books were missing from the library2. Text to Speech was missing3. There was NO AUDIO support at all.This is major regression in the product line, by far the least useful Kindle I've ever owned.  As a stockholder, I'm angry and embarrassed."
"2911","I love it! :)"
"2912","Very happy!!!"
"2913","Great device!"
"2914","Working great"
"2915","great product"
"2916","no distortion"
"2917","As described."
"2918","PERFECT!  Looked everywhere - cases for the Touch are difficult to find - this was cost effective, made well and does the job.  Does not have a light, but well worth the price.  Compact and well padded.  Great Deal!"
"2919","great device!"
"2920","The Kindle touchscreen is perfect. I does one thing  and does it well. Easy on the eyes it's a great way to read a book."
"2921","Nice purchase"
"2922","It was a gift"
"2923","I've never owned a kindle before so this was a good way to work into it. I also don't need anything crazy fancy, because all I want to do is simply read a book.  It does suck not having the light option, but I knew that when I bought it. If you're looking for just an easy way to be able to read your book then this is definitely the way to go. If you're a little more picky and want something fancy, do not buy this kindle."
"2924","As described."
"2925","Great product"
"2926","An O. K kindle coming from the kindle fire.. Would have purchased the kindle paper white for the additional $10 had I realized that there's no backlight. This limits my nighttime reading..Don't mind that it's even black and white, the no lighting is killing me!!!"
"2927","Love it!  It is so light  - a pleasure to handle and read.  The fonts are awesome and help my not-so-good eye sight.  Being glare free is soooo good!  I read for pleasure and past time and love having a line up of books ready all the time."
"2928","This basic Kindle is very good. I'm reading books on it now and it's battery is lasting quite well. Thank you, Amazon!"
"2929","Bought for husband, but he hasn't uploaded anything on it yet.  Is reading the Kindle instructions.  I commend him for that.  I still don't know how to TOTALLY turn mine off, so it won't bleed my battery dry."
"2930","Some other reviewers are bashing those of us who prefer the ""old"" button page turners. That's OK, it's a preference, but I still like the buttons better, and for me the old one was easier to navigate."
"2931","This kindle is the best just for book! It's small enough to fit anywhere and really nice for reading at the beach, or anywhere outside! The battery from just buying it lasted over a week and I read everyday. I would highly recommend this."
"2932","Lighter and easier to hold than a book, even a paperback.  Fairly easy to use, although it does take a bit to figure out all the ""how to's"".  Great for the beginner.  Great for us, book lovers with very little space to store books!"
"2933","I only wish I tried this sooner! A real breakthrough in reading, with font choice and margins. Screen is also great."
"2934","The OS is a pure nightmare. The synchronisation is nearly impossible. We were trying to load it up with books for the kids for traveling. Turns out that NONE of the books were actually loaded - only the preview picture.The management of each kids library DOES NOT EXIST on the kindle, and must be done on the computer. Again, a brain dead aspect when travelling. The kid system is actually totally dumb. Obviously, they NEVER had a kid. I can't decide if it was designed so an adult can keep the kids out, or what. We bought this as a Xmas present for a kid ... and gosh - reading on a laptop is easier for him!Thanks Kindle for letting my kids down, miles from any internet connection, and NO book to read."
"2935","Get the Paperwhite instead so you can still read at night."
"2936","I chose this kindle because of the type of screen (no back lighting). I look at a computer all day for work and wanted something that was easier on the eyes. This kindle definately fits the bill. Great product for the price."
"2937","I will not buy a Kindle again. I have the Kindle 6"" blk. I purchased it in March and it pooped out in August. The screen imprint froze onto the screen. They sent me a new one and alas it has pooped out again. I charge it and it says it isn't charged, and it won't find my network even though I can get onto internet on computer fine. So I had to download my books via cable. I also restarted the Kindle 3 times and turned it off for the night. I also charged it for 3 hours. That was fine with me, but it won't charge, so I am screwed.I called Amazon and they had me turn off my router...which doesn't make sense since my computer gets onto internet fine. She had me turn off Kindle and now I can't get it to turn back on. They are sending me a new charger, although I don't know how that will fix the problem with it not recognizing my network. Also, my old charger worked fine 2 weeks ago.I will try the new charger but am fed up with the Kindle product.Will try Nook now.VERY DISCOURGED!"
"2938","This would have been my first kindle. However, I was sorely disappointed. The screen was so dark that I needed more light to read than I do with a regular book.I'm not eager enough for a kindle to spend $119 for the paper white."
"2939","Wife loves it"
"2940","This is my first Kindle and I am truely enjoying the experience.  I particularly enjoy the ability to  look up words I am not familiar with immediately with no disruption to the story that is unfolding."
"2941","This was a present to myself from myself with a whole lot of love. I do love this kindle and I love the fact that I bought it for myself with my own money. It is so nice to have when you travel or have to haul yourself around with a load of stuff. It is lightweight and easy to handle and such a nice invention. Thank you to whomever invented it. I wish I had purchased it a long time ago."
"2942","I'm sad I cannot get a new Kindle that's as easy to change pages as my old one. I never had to lift my thumb. This one as well as paperwhite,not only do you need to swipe the page but you have to be right handed because you can only swipe on the right hand side of the page."
"2943","Sweet and easy"
"2944","Hard to read home page titles.  Titles in prose much better."
"2945","I don't love it and I don't hate it. My husband got a good deal on for my Christmas presents so that is a plus. Also I like that it's glare-free for me to use outdoors. I will say after using the Kindle app on my iPhone it's hard to adjust to the screen not being as bright. Overall I like it for outdoor use and when I'm taking a bath."
"2946","Exactly what we expected from the description given.  Love the glare free screen.  Fortunately we had read a review that reminded us the power cord was not included, so had ordered it at the same time. Happy with this order."
"2947","This is my first e-reader and I love it. Nice size, easy to use. This one is not the back-lit model, but I decided I didn't need that for the difference in price between this one and the back-lit model. Couldn't be happier."
"2948","Have had trouble with screen freezing and have already had to go back to factory settings after only ten days.  I hope this fixes the problem.  I like the glare free screen as compared to my Kindle Fire."
"2949","I love this Kindle. It's so simple and easy to use. No glare keeps me from getting headaches the way I normally do. I'm probably going to purchase another so the husband and I don't have to fight over the one."
"2950","Awesome, love the easy touch screen and the fact that there is no glare.  Makes it easy to read everywhere."
"2951","Very satisfied"
"2952","Amazing seller"
"2953","most excellent"
"2954","Great product."
"2955","So far so good"
"2956","good buy - I bought the kids bundle for myself - I don't need the light and wanted just a plain e reader."
"2957","It turns on a lot without me touching it but I am going to get a case for it soon, so that shouldn't be a problem.  Otherwise, just as easy to use as my last Kindle, but with awesome touch screen that I have to get used to!"
"2958","really like it"
"2959","Love my kindle"
"2960","Great Product."
"2961","Love my Kindle"
"2962","Great product!"
"2963","Best gift ever"
"2964","It was fine, however, I probably should have went for the Fire model, which has more features for 20% more costs.Otherwise, I am reasonably satisfied, except for not being able to adjust the screen brightness for daylight reading."
"2965","EZ to operate."
"2966","Great product!"
"2967","Handy Portable"
"2968","I love it ...."
"2969","Amazing value!"
"2970","Touchscreen is awful. Messes up page navigation all the time. Get something with physical buttons!"
"2971","good value for the price, only drawback is that it lacks a backlight (as stated in it's description) so you need to read it under the same lighting conditions that you would need to read a regular book."
"2972","First Kindle had problem.  Exchanged was hassle-free.  Dealing with Amazon is always a pleasure."
"2973","My series one was good but this version of the Kindle is great! I really like the touch screen."
"2974","I often use my smartphone to read books -- with a 5-6"" screen, most smartphones are great for this purpose now. And I use a program called 'screen filter' to significantly darken my phone screen beyond its typical minimum brightness. This isn't a bad solution. However, the phone's screen is still a little brighter than I'd like but any darker and it would become difficult to read.I'd read about the Paperwhite's back light and it sounded like that'd be a great solution. A very subtle back light I could use and maintain easy readability. Even though the device is much slower and less responsive than a phone, and much physically larger, and has no physical buttons that you can use to turn pages as you can with a phone's volume buttons, I thought it would be worth while for the back light.When Amazon had their prime day sale (more like prime day fail, am i rite guys?) I grabbed a kindle that i'd been considering for some time. The way they set up the sale, you are expected to hurry and buy without thinking and without looking at the product, but i'd already considered it and knew i wanted one, so the price seemed like a great opportunity. Unfortunately, Amazon removed the single killer-feature that this thing had and i was unaware.""Buying"" books on kindle can save you money even though many prefer the physical books. Keep in mind you do not own ebooks and there have been several instances of Amazon taking away people's books from their devices, and removing their accounts, such as the instance of Linn Nygaard. Amazon reminded users that they do not own ebooks they purchase, but that they only have a license to view them that Amazon can revoke at any time and they've done so historically without any explanation to the users and in many cases without any potential recourse.This device would probably be nice for reading books outside. For my purposes, unfortunately, it's inferior to a mobile phone in every way."
"2975","So far so good"
"2976","It's wonderful"
"2977","good purchase!"
"2978","Perfect reader"
"2979","Great love it!"
"2980","Amazing reader"
"2981","spent a long time with Amazon support before I could get it registered. This was a Christmas present for one of my children. Amazon support couldn't even figure out which Kindle I had. The first support guy passed my over to a ""specialist"" who then had me put in the serial number AGAIN and then had me go through the device again menu system to put in the same serial number AGAIN. Apparently the one they sent out to me wasn't the one that was registered to my account. I could understand the problem if we had purchased from a third party, but this was purchased from Amazon. Common Amazon logistics !. Nothing worse than buying a present and spending 2 hours on Christmas day trying to figure out why it won't work.."
"2982","Excellent buy."
"2983","Great Product!"
"2984","Love my Kindle"
"2985","Great product."
"2986","I bought the Kindle to replace my physical books. However from day one I realized that the default brightness of the screen in ambient light is very poor compared to a paper book. The Kindle requires quite a lot of ambient light to be easily readable. Is there any comparison to what the brightness levels are compared to the paper. I know printing paper have brightness standards and that plays a very important role in how visible the print is in ambient light.  The screen is almost grey and not white as  I would have liked it to be. Hopefully future versions of Kindle will fix this brightness and improve readability in limited light."
"2987","Really like it but I will need to get a light at some point. Very easy to use. Im happy."
"2988","This works great but I really should have bought the next size up. I'm getting older and making the letters bigger only means more page turns. Also... no backlight and I've yet to find a good cover with a built in light. I tend to read after my husband is asleep. A light would be handy."
"2989","I love it, it is exactly what I expected. Very light weight. Easy to hold while reading. I use it when I am at the pool with my grand-kids my kindle fire was hard to use because of the glare and this is perfect."
"2990","Out of date, this is like using a Palm pilot. Yes, thank god, it finally has a touch screen, which it should have had five years ago, but the software is old, the resolution is poor and the feel is cheap. The screen also jumps between high contrast white and black when changing pages. Overall, it's very stressful on my eyes. Amazon really has no excuse for making such a poor product. They really need to upgrade this basic kindle, especially for the price. I returned it and will continue to use my library."
"2991","Very upset, just 4 months in my kindle will not charge, this is to do with the connection at the top? Will not take any chargers with narrow piece , even though I have charged it many times before. Now I believe it was a waste of money"
"2992","I have had my Kindle Fire for about 4 yrs now and I am just now having to replace it because it will no longer charge! I have truly enjoyed my kindle! If you love to read then I recommend this product 100%"
"2993","Good. But little bit useless :)I mean we do not use it a lot as other devices"
"2994","Love my Kindle"
"2995","It is easy to use, holds battery power for weeks!, and is light weight.  I love it!"
"2996","Very satisfied"
"2997","I'm still learning how to use this new Kindle. I do not like the way the menu shows which books I have available., and I have to read up on how to erase a book after I have finished it. those are just matters I have to learn to adjust to. I have adjusted to the swipe screen and find it easier to use than anticipate, and I like the clarity and easy to read screen."
"2998","This device is hardly an improvement from the former button-model Kindle.  In its fervor to join the touchscreen craze, Amazon designers created a vastly inferior, user-unfriendly product.  Far more difficult to navigate than its simper predecessor, users can no longer see their owned books in a sequenced listing, but must conduct a tortuous search jumping from one screen to another in a futile attempt to locate the screen on which the system has randomly placed a title. Shame on you, Jeff Bezos!"
"2999","Great product!"
"3000","We are definitely an Amazon family. The addition of this new glare-free kindle keeps my little one learning on the go. The only feature I wish it has is a text-to-speak feature, so it could read to her."
"3001","My best friend"
"3002","Pages are difficult to turn when reading a book. Right margin needs more space."
"3003","The instructions were written back to front and I had to search for the items I wished to understand. Not really impressed with this Kindle as I find it hard to place my books in the order that I want. Also touch screen is overated."
"3004","Size & clarity"
"3005","This is a far inferior product to my previous Kindle. There is no button on the device to press to take me back to the home screen. There is no connection for a case that comes with a built in light (and of COURSE there is no option for backlight). I am extremely disappointed with Amazon's design for the ""new"" generation Kindle. Don't buy it. Unless you honestly can afford only the cheap option. Because that's what this is. It's a cheap piece of ****."
"3006","I'm satisfied."
"3007","Very enjoyable"
"3008","I like it for reading.No glare screen so you can read for hours. It also has dictionary installed and will be up automatically when you select a word.I just hate the Kindle Store when access from Kindle. It doesn't show different genres of Kindle books that I might like. Just because I bought one or two romance novels doesn't means that would  all I ever want to read. I still prefer self-help books but those nearly never came-up in my search in Kindle Store. I am also not able to choose that category when looking for books.I look for Kindle books and buy them from my laptop."
"3009","very good item"
"3010","Easy to download, use, read & understand. Fast shipping! In great condition."
"3011","I have had the Kindle paperwhite for a while and I loved it. Amazon decided to update the paperwhite and they did. Now I am not happy with it. Change for the better is good but that is not what they did. They changed a great product to a reasonably good product and they can change it again anytime they please. I am sorry I bought it. The next change may totally ruin it."
"3012","kids love them"
"3013","I was told ""The instructions come with it.""  NOPE!  You have to KNOW HOW to use a Kindle in order to LEARN HOW to use it.  Dumb, huh?  Not me!  I have a college degree,and I am a Pro PhotoShop Wizard, but no eReader Knowledge. WORTH the struggle  But, what of?  WHAT OF!!  The sheer ingenious of this ereader BLEW ME AWAY!!  I have downloaded FREE books from BookBub (highly rated!) to my PC.  Then I read HOW-TO download my entire Folder of my eBooks to my Kindle IN A SNAP!  Or a choice of downloading only one at a time,  But WHY would 'ya? (lol)  'Cause this great gizmo can hold a bi-zillion.  My poor aching hands don't protest at all to this light, LIGHTER THAN A PAPERBACK , easy to use & enjoy KINDLE.  I had to read with a light on before, 'tis no big deal to not have the PaperWhite, and this deal was irresistable!  LOVE MY KINDLE.."
"3014","It was awesome"
"3015","I can't rate it because I couldn't charge it.  It was a gift.  I wanted to download a book for the recipient.  I gave it away, probably wasted $60 as the recipient is not computer savvy, can't see why they would be able to charge it if I could not.  INSTRUCTIONS ARE ON THE DEVICE WHICH WON'T CHARGE."
"3016","It works great"
"3017","I had a Kindle with the keyboard at the bottom - so I'm still learning to use the touch screen. I wouldn't be without my new Kindle. Even though my fingers go to the right edge and left edge to turn pages yet; I only have to unlearn that and get used to the swiping for page turns. The reading and lack of glare are excellent. And it's a little lighter.Thanks for a great product!"
"3018","It has an add on the screen unless you pay money to have it turned on. This is a add subsidized device. I don't mind it but I hope it does not cause screen burn in. Its a great device, I am still getting used to touching the screen in the right places but its not too bad. If I don't use it in a while I have trouble remembering how to get main menu up. Books with lighter or pencil pictures or drawings like the heads first oreilly books don't display well but if you have an issue just return the book to amazon. All the negatives aside its great, its easier to read on here than a regular book, good text spacing and adjustable font size. Its cheap so I am not worried about it getting stolen.I will say the cover for it is really expensive. You might want to get a higher version which has more covers available at lower cost. For like 10 - 20 more I could have gotten a better kindle and a really cool cover instead of a black one. The black one I have is nice but its basic. Plan ahead."
"3019","Good Device but I am wondering how to reboot this kindle if left in the heat too long. My other kindle was able to do this because it had a push button for the off switch but this new kindle has a button on the screen which won't help me if it is fried. But a good read anyway."
"3020","I was looking for a newer kindle like the original Kindle. This was a major disappointment. Too many changes to the diplay format makes this the worst Kindle to ever hit the market. I gave this one away hopefully they will like it."
"3021","Quality Machine"
"3022","Very satisfied!"
"3023","My Kindle purchase was the best as well as the quality of the item"
"3024","Reading on the Kindle is easier on my eyes than reading on my iPad."
"3025","None of the Kindle e-readers support audio anymore! Unlike the older versions which supported audible audio books and mp3, now one is forced to buy a tablet to listen to audio books. Sadly, many people including myself, find tablets inferior to readers for actual reading. Tablet display creates far greater eye strain than e-ink."
"3026","I wanted an E-book ,not a damn complicated POS. Some damn techno geek had to go and make it harder to use. Inadvertantly touch the screen and you loose your page , or bring up some useless info you don't need or want. If there was a way to bring my old one back from the dead I WOULD. Not happy with it."
"3027","good，i love it."
"3028","Awesome device!"
"3029","great & simple."
"3030","I bought this Kindle for an elderly friend who had been using a prior version which had ""died."" This Kindle doesn't offer the Home Page and Menu like the old one so it is harder for her to manage her books. She needed large print. The largest is too big with too few words on the page; however, the next to largest is a bit too small....Is going to take some adjustments!"
"3031","Great product  Long lasting battery.  Clear and easy to read."
"3032","First one died, I figured that I would be buying a new one but I called and after some very efficient tech help amazon replaced it. I love the service and I really love my Fire. I mean I really love it."
"3033","Product failed in a few months, one of two kindles that failed in a month. We're on a world tour and now have no Kindle device, no access to Library except via phone app. Terrible experience with customer service, hours on the phone, refusal to ship replacements overseas, lame and false excuses given. From my experience, these are not good products."
"3034","Received my new kindle yesterday and yes it is very easy on the eyes. However I deducted 2 stars because after paying for an ad free Kindle I still can not change the screensaver and can not change the order of my books the way I want them to appear. I'm really unhappy with that."
"3035","Hated it.  Sent it back in exchange for a Paperwhite.  It was hard to read and I definitely was going crazy within the first day.  The Paperwhite is much, much better for not much of a price difference."
"3036","Pro: Very portable and easy to operate. Screen is perfect for reading in any type of lighting. Battery life is great. Much lighter that carrying hard copy.Con: They do not disclose that some e-books will not work. I bought a textbook about C++ programming that works on my PC based Kindle application, but does not work with the Kindle reader. It could be because of the lack of color but it does not state why. This was the first book I tried to read and I was very disappointed to see it fail compatibility. At this point, I still don't know for sure which books are compatible until after I buy it. Not cool. The readers page numbers are not synced with the books page numbers. That results in the book index becoming almost useless.Update: Despite what they claim, there is no compatibility information on textbooks at the time you buy them. To date, not a single textbook has worked on this device. I do not recommend for students. Waste of money."
"3037","I love kindle, I love Amazon. The only reason that I did not give this kindle 5 stars is due to the following: no cases are available with the built in light. My husband and I ordered two of these believing them to be back lit. They are not. My husband doesn't care so much about a case with a light. I do. I read in low light, or in places where more than your average room light will simply not due. The cases that are currently available have these cheap clip on lights. Can't do it. The old kindle I have now has a case with a built in light.. I'm in love, yet alas, it is getting old and has dim/dark spots showing up on the screen. This makes me sad sad sad. In closing, I have to send this kindle back for a paper white which is more expensive, yet I have to believe it will be worth it in the long run. Amazon: you come out with a new kindle, WITHOUT a light, make positive you have a case with a built in light READY to go! In fact sell them together!"
"3038","It was very difficult to get the books I purchased moved to my new kindle. In order to get the books you purchased after finishing one is also complicated. I am not happy with the new version vs. the original."
"3039","I was on the phone for 30 minutes trying to activate this Kindle. With a representative who had a heavy foreign accent I could not understand and  made me feel like an idiot because I did not understand his technical terms. Enough I returned it today."
"3040","great. holds a charge forever. easy to use. love it."
"3041","Great Gift Ever"
"3042","I give it a 4 because I don't like the home screen with the book ad's at the bottom. Also, I haven't figured out how to turn off wi-fi yet on this new one. I know I'm going to enjoy this Kindle but I sure miss the 2nd Edition that I used for 9 years."
"3043","nice, real nice"
"3044","I have kindle on my phone, it is handy. I like the Kindle's  bigger screen, it reads better and when I use the Kindle, I am saving the battery on my phone. I give it a 4 star because when I turn it on, I get advertisements for a lot of books I don't want. If that could be turned off, it would be a 5 star."
"3045","I like the unit"
"3046","great i love it"
"3047","Mom's loving it"
"3048","I used to have a 5th generation kindle.  It was thinner, more comfortable and I totally prefer the buttons to touch screen.  My daughter and I are fighting over the remaining 5th generation we have.  This new kindle is a big step down in my opinion.  Please just bring back the cheapest 5th generation kindle."
"3049","I have been spoiled by the Kindle Fire HDX, but I was looking for something lighter weight and longer battery life for travel. Fine if all you want to do is read. Very light weight. Reading in low light not so good. Experimental browser not so great."
"3050","My second reader and I love it's simplicity"
"3051","good protection"
"3052","Works perfectly"
"3053","Very convenient"
"3054","Allows access to Wikipedia access just out of the package.  You have to make the effort to set parental controls!!!  I was looking for a safe, kid friendly device so my kiddo could read lots of good books without the hassle of setting up parental controls. Yes Wikipedia contains lots and lots of trashy images i do not want my young child exposed to."
"3055","This is my first e-reader, and I'm still getting acquainted with it. I find it very easy to read, and I like the page-turning feature a lot.  I also like the size and weight (like a feather!), and I will really love it when I travel.  I find it very awkward to turn off, and I'm never certain it's really off. I would like to be able to make the screen a bit brighter, but I can't find that feature anywhere. I particularly value the ability to download books -- I live a distance from any book store -- and the downloads happen in a flash. I am not crazy about the pop-up ads for books and other products, and I find it difficult to get rid of them so I can actually read my book. I am very happy to have an electronic gadget that's dedicated to just one purpose -- reading. I guess my jury's still out."
"3056","no regrets... glad i got it on sale!!!"
"3057","My son loves it"
"3058","Awesome love it"
"3059","So far so good."
"3060","Love my kindle!"
"3061","So far so good!"
"3062","I purchased this version after I cracked the screen on my Kindle Keyboard. I didnt want to part with it but I thought this would be the most economical option instead of replacing the screen. I was pleasantly surprised how much I loved this new version. Although it's quite smaller than the Kindle Keyboard, it's compact enough to fit easily into my purse without taking up too much space. I also love that you can read with one hand and not have to put much energy in changing the pages. As lazy as that sounds the convenience is nice."
"3063","I wish I hadn't purchased this.  My first Kindle was the keyboard version.  I own a Kindle Fire now but I thought I wanted the easy-on-the-eyes screen.  So, such fond memories I had of my first Kindle.  This current Kindle --6"" glare free touchscreen--doesn't deserve the name. They've now made it so light that it feels cheap and puny. Why do people think they have to keep messing with something that was fine to begin with?  I LOVED my keyboard kindle....easy to understand, easy to operate.  I didn't realize how wonderful it was to push a button and actually get a response.  This touchscreen has nearly made me swear sometimes.  I touch here, I touch there....nothing. Or, worse, it's completely what I didn't want.  I'd send it back but frankly, it's more trouble than it's worth."
"3064","I am disappointed with this product. When i got it I loved the size and how nice and easy it is for reading. However, when I downloaded my first text book it won't work. So if you buying to read regular books it's awesome, if you buy it thinking that you will read text books, forget it, it won't work. So know I have to read my textbooks from school on my cell phone app till the my kindle fire arrived here after sept 30."
"3065","Not very bright"
"3066","Works Great!!!!"
"3067","Perfect for me."
"3068","I just love it!"
"3069","Love my Kindle."
"3070","Liked it a lot."
"3071","LOVE THE KINDLE"
"3072","It is very good"
"3073","There weren't enough instructions on how to set this thing up, and buy books from Amazon, and so forth. Getting a short user guide together would be easy, and it is needed!! The on-line guide doesn't quite do the trick."
"3074","The touch screen is too sensitive  and I have had a hard time figuring out how to operarte Kinkle 6. Many times when the page turner is touched too hard it will skip to many pages rather than the next and then one has a hard time getting back to the ""next page""."
"3075","I wish I had sprung for the Paper White. It's lightweight but has a weird thickness. The controls aren't the most intuitive and some of them seem super sensitive. My hair has fallen onto the screen and Kindle will open up the Text Size adjustment settings."
"3076","Is this one the 2nd generation ? Im very interested in some book that have only kindle version and available for the 2nd generation. Just want to make sure if Im gonna be able to read those books with this kindle or not."
"3077","since these have a touch screen they don't do to well when put in a waterproof bag. I use ziplog bags. As soon as a water drop hits the bag where the screen is the size of the letter either goes huge or tiny. Had to go on craigslist and by one of the older models to be able to use it in the summer in the pool. Other then that is works fine."
"3078","My  new kindle is not working, I only used twice!!!I need help!"
"3079","I should have read more about it. It does not have a lighted screen."
"3080","What a great epic work! Hard to read, but the descriptions of the era, or the battle of Waterloo etc. are just fantastic. (I could have gone without the description of the convent and the nuns though). As in other classics, those descriptions take a bigger part of the book compered to the actual plot. Overall a great book by a great author."
"3081","It was average."
"3082","I like the Kindle but very disappointed that I cannot find a cover with a builtin light like my first Kindle.  The builtin light was very convenient when reading in a car or in bed at night. I am now regretting my purchase."
"3083","I'm not buying any more of these contraptions--they dissolve like alka seltzer tablets. They only seem to last a year or two. I had my next-older version of this one freeze on me twice and that was my second one bought last September. The first one I bought in March 2011. So this is my third one. I don't buy the claims of how many books they hold, especially since I only have a couple hundred titles and I think that's why the second one froze on me--indigestion. And one thing this one is missing is a manual of some sort. I had to stumble my way through this one, trial-and-error, before I could access the book I had tried to download to Kindle Numbah Two when it froze, so I came here for another download of the book to this new one when it showed up. They also really need a manual so you know which part of the screen you touch to get what result."
"3084","I don't often write reviews, but I must say how disappointed that the manufacturer placed the power button on the bottom of this reader.  Who doesn't like to prop up their reader against a surface to read hands free?  Well, I guess the product designer.  Whenever you try to prop the device, put it on your lap and rest against your knees, it turns the device off.  GRRRR."
"3085","I purchased this to replace my original Kindle which finally wore out. It is a terrible product and I wish Amazon would quit selling it because it is not up to their usual standard of quality. The gray screen makes reading very hard on the eyes. The touch points to access the home page etc are inconsistent and you just can't get it to come up at times. The feature changing the text size comes up when you don't want it to.I was able to trade this in after 2 months and got a Paperwhite instead, which I love.Don't waste your money on this. Get a Paperwhite."
"3086","My daughter does a lot of reading and this was the perfect gift for her. The kindle came well packaged. Getting it up and running was pretty easy. She is 9 and has no problem navigating the menus. I like that fact that I can see how long she has been reading and what she is reading. She can spend a whole day reading. Alas between her older sister and little brother her kindle is now lost. She has to read the old fashioned way again."
"3087","I like this item"
"3088","Sadly, I am sending this back--thank you Amazon for letting me do this.  I have had three kindles, but I just don't like the feel of this one.  I have a keyboard Kindle, which my husband has inherited, and frankly, it's better.  I've had this for about 2 months, have used it and tried to learn to like it, but it isn't as easy to use or as intuitive as I am used to.  I'm ordering a paperwhite and I am hoping that I like it better--at least I will be able to read in the dark now."
"3089","Reads well;however wish it had a ""lighted"" screen and there is no way to go from the last page to the first without clicking page by page back, ugh!"
"3090","I cannot read on my phone or laptop for extended periods of time because it hurts my eyes, but using a kindle is completely different. The screen doesn't hurt my eyes and seems more like a book page."
"3091","I liked it better when I could delete books back to my computer.  Now it feels cluttered and when I want to read a new book, they all show up and I can't remember what I already read. It's confusing."
"3092","The highlighting and note functions are excellent.Now I can read newspapers, magazines,  and books without having to recycle.The fonts can be adjusted for those of us"" nearsighted"" challanged"
"3093","It was exactly what I needed.  I can read outside without any issues and downloads are easy.  It is inexpensive and has great battery life.  I have a Kindle Fire for anything else that I need to do."
"3094","Quality e-reader"
"3095","What I expected."
"3096","Just what I need"
"3097","Works flawlessly"
"3098","Good product! :D"
"3099","Really enjoy it!"
"3100","So far real good"
"3101","My first Kindle. Love it. Great for me as I am on the road. I would enjoy more if lit. But there are drawbacks there also. My wife has four! Guess there are more than enough available for any taste."
"3102","Just got this to replace an old kindle with keyboard, about six years old. Love the touch screen!  Battery life is great. Simple to use. Can read on the beach with no issues. Great value for the money. Light weight, fits in pocketbook. If you love to read, this is the way to go."
"3103","Responding for Mark Shoemaker - want to be able to reference page numbers more clearly, to search back and forth more easily, couldn't get the hang of touch screen, and prefer to read a print book."
"3104","This review is for the “FREE” warrantee that came with the kindle. I Love the Kindle itself but I bought this kindle under a pkg. deal call Kindle Kids Bundle. This was to include a cover for the kindle and a free 2 year warrantee. I just spent 1 hour on the phone trying to get the warrantee and was transferred from Donna to Grena (who was the right person to talk to) who decided it was retail (Adrian) who I needed to talk to, who decided it was someone else I needed to talk to. Each person put me on hold for several minutes ( I think they get reimbursed by the minutes they spend on phone) and came back to transfer me again. NO THANKS. I think the warrantee they give you is for $12 and I just spent1 hour on the phone! Customer service needs to look at what their employees are doing."
"3105","I like my kindle"
"3106","I really love it"
"3107","A great reader!!"
"3108","I love my Kindle"
"3109","Bought this for my 8-year-old as she loves to read and hates having to be sure her tablet is charged. She loves having this and is glad she can take it to school and read often between charges."
"3110","Awesome product. So exiting with quality. Sensor display is amazing. If you don't need built in light I highly recommend you to buy basic model. The price is awesome. Thanks for great product."
"3111","Awesome. Love it"
"3112","This is perfect for my grand daughter.  I can control what she reads.  When she had a tablet all she did was download apps and play games.  Now she has to read which really cramps her style."
"3113","Wow... The screen looks considerably better than the competitors.. I've used others and none looked this natural and close to paper. I think my conversion to digital books is now complete."
"3114","works wonderful!"
"3115","i really like it"
"3116","Use it regularly"
"3117","works as spected"
"3118","Awesome love it!"
"3119","Good product ..."
"3120","It's fine I just or shall I say my husband didn't realize that it day light only . I got more use or of the one I had before he didn't think you made one without the light. So he didn't notice until we turned it on"
"3121","I am in love with my kindle! Buying with special offers was more affordable for me and I am so glad I got it. I was unsure of having the advertisements, but they do not bother me at all!"
"3122","It's a Kindle, it feels fantastic in my hand and works very well. Quick loading, easy to use and read. Battery lasts a long time, I can use it all day and lose maybe 5% of the battery."
"3123","It's easy to use"
"3124","It does the job!"
"3125","Love my Kindle!!"
"3126","Awesome product!"
"3127","I kind of miss the keyboard! And I find it slightly difficult to get back to the homepage and navigate due to the touch screen.  Also, having purchased this for my 6yo, I didn't realize how limited the options were for kindle books that worked on this version.  Very limited. We had purchased books for it before receiving it as a gift package for her for Christmas only to find upon firing it up that the books weren't compatible. Very disappointed mama and 6yo here :(Hopefully she picks up reading chapter books soon so she can use this device!"
"3128","This is my favorite reading device.  I have had 2 other kindles, the oldest one 5 years old has finally died the other is a Fire.  The FIre is not ideal for reading but this one is."
"3129","Great product!!!"
"3130","Adore my kindle."
"3131","best one ive had"
"3132","awesome, thanks!"
"3133","Pretty cool case"
"3134","So easy on my eyes! Quick downloads through the wifi. Much better than reading on my iPad, and it's great to not be distracted by anything other than my books. Excellent purchase."
"3135","It is very clear however, the touch sensitivity of the screen is way too high. I often find the text size has changed or some other change has happened just from putting it down."
"3136","I LOVE IT THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LIGHT ON AT NIGHT TO READ IT"
"3137","Love this e-reader. It's a great device for reading indoors or outdoors."
"3138","Compact, lightweight and convenient.  This reader meets my expectations."
"3139","works very well."
"3140","This Kindle is a replacement for my second generation Kindle. I like the touch screen features very much. The smaller size is perfect. I'm thoroughly satisfied with this Kindle."
"3141","Still learning how to use the item but looks nice and like the way it reads."
"3142","It is good. But experiencing a flicker when moving from one page to another."
"3143","Best thing I could have gotten with my busy schedule.  I still miss the feel of paper when i turn the page but it is pretty nice to be able to carry more than one book with me."
"3144","Screen was to dark & gray to read by,and i don't believe it was adjustable"
"3145","We are very happy with our Kindle it's a lot better than I had anticipated"
"3146","I love being able to take it and read my books where ever I want. Love it."
"3147","I got this as a gift for my Mom, Unfortunately... If I turn the kindle on, some Chinese characters are frozen on the screen & I can't get anything to move.  I can't even turn it off.  It will shut off by itself after awhile.  Kindle support online or by phone wants $39 just to answer a question!!! Talk about corporate greed. Amazon, don't forget just what & who made you a great company in the 1st place..."
"3148","Really nice screen, lightweight, thin, a pleasure to read. Has acted wonky a couple of times and stopped responding, but has returned to normal after restart. Fantastic price."
"3149","Enjoyed it so far"
"3150","This is my second Kindle.  My first was an 'oldie' and when turned off, it displayed line drawings of famous authors on the screen.  The new one displays ADS :(  Admittedly the ads are for books but still, they are ads.So I guess my real qualm is not with the product per se but with the decision to use this item as a continuous digital billboard. Bah!"
"3151","Met or exceeded my expectations. I wanted portability for traveling and the simplicity of another device. Touchscreen and cloud capability much better than my vintage Kindle."
"3152","My kid loves it !"
"3153","I don't like having the touch screen because I keep touching it by mistake.  I only ordered this because my other one seemed ready to die, but I sure like the old one better."
"3154","Works great, just having to get use to the touch screen, keep accidently changing pages or bringing up another resource but that's on me. It is easy to read and change pages."
"3155","Perfect Condition"
"3156","I have a Kindle Keyboard 3G and love it.  The forward turn button is starting to not work all the time.  Have to push it twice so I ordered the Paperwhite and absolutly hate it. It sucks the battery big time.  If anyone tells you the battery is only used when you turn a page they're full of it.  It has a light setting that you cannot shut off.  You cannot shut the paperwhite off either.  You can put it in sleep mode but the second you touch the case or move it, ever so lightly, it comes back on.  I would not recommend this to anyone and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it.  I put it away to have when my other Kindle's button finally went so it's too late for me to send it back.  Since people seem to have such a high opinion of it on here, maybe I'll sell it to some poor schmuck who didn't know better, like me.  I even bought a very good leather case with a book stand for and can't use it now.  This whole experience has NOT been a good one for me."
"3157","Love our Kindles!"
"3158","i was starting to loose my reading habit. I've got it back!! I love my new kindle I got it a week ago and I already finished my first book! Fixin' to start the second one!!!"
"3159","Kindle met all my expectations easy to use,all the books on my phone from my kindle app. Transfered to my kindle easily. The no glare screen is great.I am really satisfied."
"3160","Very easy to use."
"3161","Was everything  I was.looking for. I have the colored  one but wanted one I could read @ the beach or pool. This one is.perfect small & light weight& fits in smaller bags."
"3162","Broke the screen. Got Amazon to make an exception to replace it. TIP: Buy a screen protector case, and never ever leave it open. Always protect that screen. Breaks easily."
"3163","Love my new Kindle. The touch screen is great. With my old Kindle, I wanted to turn the pages as I do on my iPad. This is a great change and cheaper than my old Kindle."
"3164","I loved my old kindle, so learning this one has been torture. The worst part of the whole thing is that A. my old kindle is dead, so I MUST use this one, and B. There is apparently no way to add light to the subject so that you can read in the dark. I've tried to figure out how to use my old kindle cover with the fabulous light for this new one and it just won't work. Does anybody have any ideas about how to add light???"
"3165","Very easy to use."
"3166","Great for reading"
"3167","Like it a lot!  I take my Kindle everywhere with me to read in case I have to wait  I love this one because it is so light weight and doesn't make my purse so heavy!"
"3168","Perfect size for reading on the move, at the beach or in bed.The device is light and fits into a coat pocket.Great value for money and long battery life."
"3169","Awesome! Love it."
"3170","Light, easy to hold and read. I like the text integration with Wikipedia, and the X-Ray function that provides background information on characters in novels."
"3171","Got one for my girlfriend, she loves it! Doesn't have backlighting, but the battery lasts a couple weeks. It's a good tradeoff if your only intent is to read books."
"3172","i love reading and this allows me to do so with out me taking a lot of books with me instead i have them on digital and take as many as i want with out the backpack"
"3173","Excellent Device, not much difference with the resolution of the Paperwhite, i enjoy it aswell in my country without problem registering it and buying online books"
"3174","i LOVE my kindle!"
"3175","One word: Kindle!"
"3176","It was excellent."
"3177","So far l love it."
"3178","excellent product"
"3179","It's really good!"
"3180","Thank you so much"
"3181","Perfect gift for a reader, especially a grandchild. There are so many free books on the kindle site for children, plus many more books at very reasonable prices."
"3182","This product was a huge disappointment. this is my second Kindle, my first was a Kindle Keyboard which I can't say enough good things about but the screen froze on mine and my husbands two days apart so I had to replace. After much research and talking to Amazon I ordered two the 6"" glare free kindles for myself and one for my husband expecting the same type of Kindle with the same ease of use that is not what I have.This model is not user friendly, no simple button to push to get back to home, change font and to find the books you have available to read it is necessary to drag down bar from top.. For my Kindle keyboard I was able to order a cover with a built in light to read when light is not perfect, not on this model if you want a light it is separate and attaches to the cover one more things to handle.I gave this two stars and that is being generous"
"3183","The Kindle 6"" is exactly what I was looking for and it came at a great price.  Once again, Amazon demonstrates strong ability to meet customer satisfaction."
"3184","Having had a ""Nook"", I am just getting used to my Kindle.  So far, so good.  I have already downloaded several books and am enjoying my reading time.."
"3185","has some glitches"
"3186","I really like it."
"3187","My wife loves it."
"3188","You are a nerd..."
"3189","Exactly what I expected.  No bells and whistles, just a medium to read electronic books.  It almost keeps the ""reading a real book"" vibe alive for me ;)"
"3190","I am enjoying my new touchscreen Kindle - so much easier to navigate around when I try to locate books for purchase/borrow. It's easy to carry and easy to read."
"3191","power consumption not as advertised but still better than iPad or other pads.  Clarity is unbeatable!!  In that sense, this is the eReader for serious readers."
"3192","It is very slow turning pages or getting from one screen to the next. The graphics or display (don't know how to describe it) are terrible. Not a good value."
"3193","My younger son gave me a Kindle Glare-Free for my birthday,two weeks ago.How thoughtfull of him,knowing that my eyes are sensitive to light.I enjoy it a lot!"
"3194","Great, love it :)"
"3195","kindle is great.."
"3196","Yep, they got me."
"3197","Works wonderfully"
"3198","Ok for the price."
"3199","Very good. I just don't like that we must to pay more for don't have the commercials in the protection scream. But, otherwise, the e-Book it's pretty good!"
"3200","DO NOT CHANGE THE BATTERY ON THIS KINDLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And buy the extended warranty if you don't want to completely waste your money.  I had an old style Kindle a number of years ago and for a long time it did fine.  When the battery pooped out, I was able to buy new ones and change them and the Kindle worked fine.  (the Kindle batteries suck BIG TIME, but that's a whole other issue).Then came this new Kindle.  I had high hopes that it would be even better than my first, but I hate it.  It is horrible.  But I did have the presence of mind to buy the two year extended warranty, and I am so glad I did, because this Kindle crapped out on me after just 1 and 1/2 years.  So I did what I thought you were supposed to do, I got on Amazon and bought a new battery and changed it.  Well, now the Kindle does not work, and when I called to see if something could be done, I was told that changing the battery was considered ""intentional damage"" to the Kindle.  Nowhere are you warned that you should not change the battery.  Since I bought the battery through Amazon, they are going to be nice enough to replace the Kindle, which is very kind of them because I am as disgusted as I can possibly be with this Kindle version.  Now it looks like I will be getting another one, but you can bet when it no longer works I will not be trying to change the battery.  I cannot say I recommend this Kindle version, it has been user-unfriendly on a number of levels.  But I will recommend the extended warranty."
"3201","Love my Kindle! I will always prefer a real deal book over an e-book version, but for traveling when I would have to pack multiple books this is a winner."
"3202","Love my kindle..."
"3203","Works fine for me"
"3204","Love this product"
"3205","My kids enjoy it."
"3206","I love the kindle. If you get annoyed easily then get the one without the ads, as they sometimes get in the way when you're trying to turn the kindle off"
"3207","So far I love it."
"3208","I love my kindle."
"3209","Great to have it!"
"3210","The touch screen is weird. When i want to change pages i have to tap it several times. When i don't want it to, it will change multiple pages at once."
"3211","Nice improvements"
"3212","My Wife loves it."
"3213","I like the size and weight of the 6"" Kindle, but it is impossible to read in a room that is not well lit.  I should have gotten the Paperwhite."
"3214","great enjoying it."
"3215","My third and best!"
"3216","My only Black Friday purchase, my Christmas present to myself.  For the price I paid it is exactly what I need and I am very happy with this Kindle."
"3217","My beloved paperwhite died and i miss it.  I bought this one to replace it. but . . . it doesnt have a backlight.  without that backlight the screen is hard to see in dim lighting  I have returned this one.  Later i will re order a new one. possibly a kindle fire.if you need backlight - this one is not for you.  otherwise it is a nice kindle.  lightweight."
"3218","Very good product. Light, clear and easy to use.Two best things about it are: 1. can read under bright sun; 2: very long battery life."
"3219","Awesome love it!!!"
"3220","i love my kindle!!"
"3221","awesome i love it!"
"3222","Excellent e-reader"
"3223","Excellent product."
"3224","Great for reading!"
"3225","Wish I would have spent the extra $$ for the backlit one.  Unit itself is good, works great, just a little buyers remorse for my personal habits."
"3226","Meets expectations"
"3227","I'd be seriously lost and unhappy without my Kindle. That's why when my second Kindle died I quickly ordered my third one and was eager to receive it. Once I did, I charged it up and started using it immediately. However, I was greatly disappointed when I discovered that this Kindle does not have the back lit screen I enjoyed on my other Kindle. You can't always get good lighting everywhere and my old Kindle resolved that problem. I'm not sure I'm going to keep this one. I need a lit screen so I can read everywhere....even in the dark!"
"3228","The screen looks so much like a printed page. No Idea how they do it. The only thing missing from this is a light so you can read in the dark :)"
"3229","Love my little kindle, battery lasts forever and very easy to read on! I also love the dictionary option when I dont know a word! Awesome-sauce."
"3230","The Paperwhite with lit screen is big improvement over my original Kindle.  But, I do not like the touchscreen.  Much prefer the old Kindle controls and miss the alpha listing of library.  New way of listing books is impossible to read many titles and cumbersome.Some advice:  if it ain't broke -- don't fix it."
"3231","pretty good device"
"3232","I really like it convenient and  carrying in my purse i was sort confuse to how to download books i got now it was a good purchase for me thks"
"3233","I love my Kindle!!"
"3234","Taking some getting user to as I am 91 years old and new things take time . so far so good as I enjoy the large print and easy page turning ."
"3235","Just wish I had read more about it that it didn't have a light to read in the dark.  It is great for the beach absolutely love it in the day."
"3236","looks & feeis good"
"3237","Nice little device"
"3238","I don't mean to ""demean"" this product, but since Amazon insists on having people rate stuff, that's what I'm doing.This was a gift from my children.  I didn't ask for it; I asked for books... I included links... I wanted paperback books.  I later purchased two of the books I had asked for, and paid 2 cents more for both of them than I'd have paid for the Kindle version of just one.  The other book I wanted is available as an ebook from our local library.  After spending - hours?- trying to download it I finally called the library and talked to a nice woman at the reference desk.  The version our library has would download to a Nook, or a something else, or to a Kindle Fire, but NOT to a black or white Kindle.  So, after two months, my Kindle is charged, and, as far as I'm concerned, looking for its ""forever"" home.Children everywhere, do not presume to know more than your parents about everything.  You probably know more about a lot of things, but not everything. Allow your old parents their odd little preferences, and if they want to hold a book, buy a book.We have not gone on vacation for over 20 years.  I buy most of my books at thrift shops and library book sales.  Bookfinder.com is even better than Amazon for finding used books. When I finish a book I find I really liked I often pass it on to my mom (who, at 85, also has no interest in a Kindle), or my sister (also in her 60's and quite happy looking at words on paper).I have more than once, when reading, found myself having a question about some passage I'm reading and looking back to find and re-read some previous mention that I faintly recall having something to do with that passage, and I employ fingers and bookmarks to get e to and fro quickly.  Perhaps that is possible with a Kindle, but the idea of flicking back through 50 pages or more strikes me as extremely irritating.  I guess I'm just an old-fashioned girl.So, if you like gadgets, or you travel a lot, or believe this will be of benefit to you, then I suppose you should buy one, although I'd have to say based on my extremely limited experience, you might be better off with a Kindle Fire.  But if you're just thinking you really like paper books but maybe you should try to stay up with the times,  don't waste your money."
"3239","It supports a lot of books, the battery lasts a lot, the only thing is that like it has no light, reading at nigth is kind of uncomfortable."
"3240","Just as I expected"
"3241","This is my first Kindle and I'm impressed. Light, simply and intuitive. I love how easy it is on my eyes and the overall feel and operation"
"3242","trying to read more so thought a kindle was worth a shot.  really really love the glare free reading.  it's super light, no complaints yet."
"3243","Wonderful product!"
"3244","Great!  I love it!"
"3245","I love this thing."
"3246","Just what I wanted"
"3247","Lo mejos para leer"
"3248","VERY HAPPY WITH IT"
"3249","Received the refurbished kindle yesterday, was really excited about it but it won't connect to any wifi network. Will return for a new one"
"3250","I am really enjoying the Kindle 6"".  When I am reading outside, there is no glare!  Easy to carry in my purse when I am out and about."
"3251","I've been wanting to start reading, but was lacking the motivation; Kindle provides the required mobility to carry tons of books at hand."
"3252","Fantastic product!"
"3253","Kindle is perfect."
"3254","it is really nifty"
"3255","Getting used to it"
"3256","Excellent ! I have a kindle with Me ALL the time. Better then a Cell Phone.LOL  I have 2 and planning to get another to keep in My Truck."
"3257","I bought a couple of these as a gift, I have a Paperwhite. I love all the Amazon Kindle's though, they are the best e-reader hands down."
"3258","My wife really enjoys it.  I wish I had waited to buy it instead of my keyboard Kindle.  The keyboard just adds bulk and is seldom used."
"3259","I stopped reading books because I could not see the print.  I wish I would of bought this a long time ago.  Reading again and loving it!"
"3260","Good for the money.  I do miss having buttons because it's going to take getting used to having to change pages with only my right hand."
"3261","awesome thank you!"
"3262","The wife loves it."
"3263","Excellent product."
"3264","This latest version of the Kindle is good, but surprisingly inferior to my previous 2nd generation Kindle.  I am not a fan of ""touchscreens;""  I definitely preferred the side buttons for turning pages.  Many times I find it difficult to touch the screen in just the ""right place"" to avoid having the dictionary open up or the top menu appear, rather than the next page.  Also, it seems as though the battery does not stay charged as long as it did before, and this is inconvenient since I am a voracious reader."
"3265","Simple to use, easy to read on & extremely portable, I received this a s a Christmas present & it is by far my favorite gift this year."
"3266","A major upgrade from my previous e-reader! While I still have some issues navigating some of the downloads, this kindle is a blessing."
"3267","So far it is just great for what I wanted.  My Samsung Galaxy 4 (10.1) is too big and heavy for reading.  This is just the right size."
"3268","I can't say enough good things!!!!!!  The products SUPERB and. Customer service OUTSTANDING!!!!  I wishe all companies were as good :)"
"3269","im not real happy with it,but thats my fault not the kindles.i didnt realize it was a touch screen instead of having buttons to click to turn pages.i love that my kindle fire tablet is touchscreen,but i was trying to replace my earlier little 6 inch kindle,so its not the kindles fault it wasnt what i wanted.i shouldnt have ordered at 2 in the morning and read the description with more care"
"3270","The screen is so dark it is hard to read and there is no adjustment for brightness."
"3271","It's basic... No bells and whistles, it's what you would expect from a simple item."
"3272","Screen should be bigger. Well I knew I was buying a 6"" screen, but for future versions Amazon should make it 8"" at least. Maybe also make it thinner. Learn a thing or two from Apple? Also the back of the box says 4 GB. Then why do I see 3 GB? This simplistic OS cannot eat 1 GB, so don't give me that excuse."
"3273","Loved the product!"
"3274","I bought this for my partner and she wasn't going to use it but did and since New Years she has read 5 books and ""loves"" it!!"
"3275","Love that Glare-Free Kindle.  I can now read a lot longer without eye fatigue.  I am just sorry that the games can't be played on it."
"3276","Great replacement for my old original ideal.  Lightweight, touch screen much better.  Prefer the non glare style for outdoor reading."
"3277","We though we were getting the same model as my husband currently owns as travel replacement for my heavier Fire.  Product received on time,  sets up well (this is our fifth,  gets easier every time),  and everything is exactly like my husband's - - - except there is no way to adjust the brightness!  I am seventy years old and my eyes see a brighter screen more easily.  My bad,  I should have studied the product better  -  now I am stuck with a device that is difficult to use.  The gray be may be better for  YOUR eyes but it isn't for mine!"
"3278","just what I wanted....reading is better than on a tablet & doesn't need charging so often!  Love it-especially the non glare screen."
"3279","good one.I like it."
"3280","Touch too sensitive"
"3281","Very happy with it!"
"3282","Screen size is smaller than it looked. It sucks that you can't read this in the dark."
"3283","Had one before and got it wet.....twice.  Ruined it.  This was a replacement as I like to be able to read in the sun.  It is great!"
"3284","Absolutely love it."
"3285","Pleased with Kindle"
"3286","Love it the battery lasts for a few days worth of reading on and off during the day and i can read on my other kindle at night :)"
"3287","Love my new Kindle!"
"3288","It came with no directions on usage.  I thought it should have two books in it, but can find only one which I read successfully."
"3289","Great product! I bought it for my husband who doesn't really care for devices and he is hooked. Easy to use with great features!"
"3290","Great kindle for first-time kindle-device users. I loved it, I will purchase a better and color display one for better quality."
"3291","Could be a little easier to navigate eg how to change from portrait to landscape if not actually in the book you want to read."
"3292","This is my second Kindle and I couldn't be happier. I don't need any bells and whistles and this is perfect. A great bargain."
"3293","iT Worked perfectly"
"3294","My original Kindle bit the dust but it was the original model and it went everywhere with me.  I hope this one lasts as long!"
"3295","A little smaller screen than my old Kindle II, but good enough. I like the touch screen for paging, and dictionary look up."
"3296","My kindle has a black circle in the middle that is Incredibly distracting when reading. Dissatisfied with product quality!"
"3297","Easy to handle. Love the glare free. Fun to download books instead of shopping everywhere to find the one I want to read."
"3298","Loved it.......alot"
"3299","Quirky. It will take a lot longer than you expect to figure out how to use this thing, but you might like it once you do."
"3300","Love this product!!"
"3301","Excellent. Love it."
"3302","Exactly as expected"
"3303","I had to replace my Kindle Keyboard after 6 years of dedicated service.  This kindle was on sale during the Prime anniversary and a good deal at $30 off.  I read mostly at night before bed. My kindle keyboard had a beautiful leather cover with a built-in light that tapped the battery on the kindle. No need to charge anything but the kindle, and it all folded up nice and flat for travel.  Can't do that with this model. This kindle has no external light solution other than a chunky clip-on lamp with a separate battery. One more thing to carry around and have run out of battery power.  Fail. Looks like I have to buy a back-lit kindle as they no longer produce a model with the ability to tap the battery.  Or buy a used kindle keyboard."
"3304","LOVVVVE my kindle!!"
"3305","Love love love love"
"3306","Screen is too dark."
"3307","I know, I know. Everybody says to read the specs before you buy, but this one was given to me as a gift. I was reading my Kindle books on a tablet until I received the Kindle, and about a week or two after trying to adjust to the screen in dim grey tones, I gave up and went back to the tablet. As much as I would like to support Amazon and their products, I'm not sure this entry level reminder of early-80's computer monitors is for me, and judging from the reviews of other Kindles, I may just stick with the tablet. There's no reason Amazon can't afford to be on the cutting-edge with these with the number that they sell. My best use for this one is to tote it with me when I'm out and about and might have to wait in a very bright room."
"3308","Love my new Kindle."
"3309","Works as advertised"
"3310","Love the new Kindle"
"3311","I live this kindle!"
"3312","Works great!  It is a little hard to get use to having the touch screen after I had the buttons on the older model ."
"3313","Excellent e-book reader. It takes 2 or 3 hours to learn to use it. But once you get the hang of it its a lot of fun."
"3314","Bought 2 for my mom and my girlfriend. They love it! It's pretty cute, small  and compact and the battery is great."
"3315","I love it. But I thought it came with a lit screen and book lights were no longer needed. But the rest is the best."
"3316","Hi my name is marcellous and I just brought a kindle touch a few days ago. I thought the kindle web would be better then my kindle keyboard. But it's not after being on the web for five minutes (reading a web article) it kicked me off. Overall the web service would get 1 out 5 please fix."
"3317","Great basic Kindle!"
"3318","Love my new kindle."
"3319","I love this Kindle."
"3320","Great and practical"
"3321","Bought this for my husband's birthday. The touchscreen is really cool. I have an older model and I'm jealous now."
"3322","Very happy with this! Bought it for my deploying husband and he spent all day on it. Plus, it came fully charged"
"3323","great , only word ."
"3324","Handy size e-reader"
"3325","great for the beach"
"3326","My newest obsession"
"3327","I love this kindle!"
"3328","So lightweight; replaced my paperwhite. Much better screen quality than previous kindles and great battery life."
"3329","It's good for reading text.  I wish it would display covers in the menus, otherwise good value and easy to use."
"3330","BROKE MY LAST KINDLE SO I NEEDED A NEW ONE. HAD NO IDEA IT WAS SMALLER AND HAD TOUCH SCREEN NOW BUT I LOVE IT!!"
"3331","Better than a book. I've actually started reading again. Not back lit, so I need light to read....like normal!"
"3332","Great product, great price. With family sharing, everyone can read on one of the devices"
"3333","Met my expectations"
"3334","I loved my kindle 3g. Absolutely loved it. The biggest downside was how ridiculously fragile it was. So when it died again I decided to get the new kindle... As soon as a opened the box I was disappointed. Not only is it twice the weight of my 3g, it's hideous. Further, the single feature that convinced me to get the 3g instead of the OLD kindle remains the lack of physical buttons. Why in the holy Hell would ANYBODY want a touch screen? ""I know let's use our greasy fingers to turn pages and select books instead of using elegant buttons, wouldn't that be a great idea?"" Answer: F*** NO! Definitely not buying another kindle... And I haven't even properly turned this one on... Ugh."
"3335","Love it.  The only bad thing was two days after I bought it, I thought I saw $20.00 off Mother's Day Special."
"3336","I really Love this Kindle.  I like that it automatically turns off when I forget. And the no glare attribute."
"3337","Nice product.Thanks!"
"3338","nice for my bus ride"
"3339","Nice & handy device."
"3340","I'm really satisfied"
"3341","great little reader!"
"3342","Un able to retrieve any of the books from my old kindle. Can't even find the instructions to try to retrieve, via the cloud.  The initial attempt I thought was successful but not so.  Assuming this review is even read plus another review about one of the books I cannot retrieve or read, some help from Amazon would be appreciated."
"3343","I like the old Kindle better with the buttons on the side for page turning and the less extensive features."
"3344","I like it but wish I had spent a little more money so I could have gotten the model with the reading light."
"3345","No complaints. Battery lasts for 10 days with 1-2 hours of usage per day. Very easy to use and low profile."
"3346","I am disappointed in my new kindle . It is just enough bigger than my old one, therefore my lighted case does not fit it. Understand marketing manuver but now I will have to buy another lighted case. Not happy with this at all."
"3347","Perfect for reading!"
"3348","My old lady loved it"
"3349","My daughter loves it"
"3350","Great little reader."
"3351","Gracias buenproducto"
"3352","For the money I've in it I guess it's good.  Poor control features, almost like a step back in technology."
"3353","This is a classic case of getting what you pay for. The lowest priced of the Kindle models has very little to brag about. It's got a dark screen with no adjustment for brightness, and the screen is tiny and only b/w. Give me my Nook any day of the week."
"3354","Love my kindle touch"
"3355","great and convenient"
"3356","Special Offers means Advertisements.  This thing is cluttered with ads!  Amazon will remove them for $20."
"3357","Love this device. No bells and whistles, just a nice clear screen and lightweight. Battery lasts forever!"
"3358","Just what I wanted!!"
"3359","Just what we wanted,"
"3360","On time and love it!"
"3361","Very basic. I thought it would have more features. It is slower than I expected for a brand new device (page turning/homepage load slow). When it is in sleep mode it shows advertisements. I find this frustrating because it sometimes shows titles that do not reflect my personal tastes and it seem odd to friends and guests to see that when I leave it on a table. Seems strange to buy a device that would have preset ads."
"3362","Love it. I use it everyday. There is really no glare from the sun or artificial light. Worth the price!"
"3363","Kindle is the best!!"
"3364","great device for reading. actually got me to start reading after not picking up a book in over 10 years"
"3365","Works well. I like the fact that it isn't backlit because it is better for just before bedtime reading."
"3366","Great for reading. It's amazing how much the screen resembles an actual book. It's worth the $79 price."
"3367","Perfect reading device to take time off the computer/smartphone screen... my eyes are happy about it :D"
"3368","Nice small unit but I'd be cautions of the ""reads like paper"" hype. What this means is there is no back light so you still need another light source to read this in the dark, just like paper.. Other than that, pleased with the device."
"3369","I only gave it this many stars because I do not own this one yet. I'm considering buying this kindle soon because my old kindle doesn't hold a charge very long due to it's 6 year age. I love my kindle, which is the 2nd or 3rd edition. I use it 3 or 4 times a week. I carry it everywhere. I am devastated that I am in the market for a new one, but the features of this kindle reflect the features of my current kindle, with a few added perks and upgrades. I love that the price is extremely affordable. My family wants me to splurge on an iPad but I keep telling them that I only want an e-reader, specifically one from Amazon. I am leery about the touch screen since I prefer my non-touch screen kindle, but if I decide to purchase this kindle it will be something I will get used to quickly. I am currently in my senior year of college and I have used my kindle to read for my classes. I add PDF's on my kindle and read homework and bring it to class, which impresses all my English professors. I can confidently say that when I desperately need a new e-reader I will purchase this one from Amazon and continue to enjoy books, both paperback and digital."
"3370","Great for the price!"
"3371","It's a basic e-reader, nothing more, but it does the trick! Is exactly as advertised and works for me!"
"3372","took a bit of getting used to after my original kindle with the keyboard died but I really like it now"
"3373","Just returned it. I was pretty surprised at how dim it was. Do people actually like this? Tough to read in all but bright light. If you expect iPad style brightness and clarity, this will be a fail. I'll stick with the Marvin app on my iPad."
"3374","I LIKE IT VERY MUCH!"
"3375","I am just learning how to use the Kindle. I think I am really going to enjoy it very much !!MLP"
"3376","Great product for a simple person... I wanted it for reading on the go, and it is perfect!"
"3377","My original Kindle was brighter and easier to read.  Will not order another Glare-Free screen again."
"3378","This is my third Kindle.! I love it. I am a beach lady - the Kindle is easy to read in the sun light"
"3379","Should have had better instructions for use included, there were none. It is a much smaller device than I expected. I would still like better written instructions on how to use this device. I'm not clear on how to get around on it. I really enjoyed my old Kindle, could easily get from home to ordering new books."
"3380","I love my Kindle  :)"
"3381","I have the voyager. It's okay but miss being able to have my screen black with white writing ( less light at night and harder on the eyes).  Battery life is okay.  And no color. Was using a samsung 7 and iPad. Do like the lightness and size of it"
"3382","great gift for wife."
"3383","I love my new Kindle"
"3384","Arrived as expected."
"3385","Loving it!  Can read in the sun with no glare!  Books migrated from old readers with no hesitation."
"3386","Love love love my little Kindle.  It's  light, and easy to use.  The book ads don't even bother me."
"3387","very good experience"
"3388","I love my new kindle"
"3389","Now I will be able to read outdoors again. My Kindle Fire is useless in bright sunlight."
"3390","I like the first generation because the keyboard was available, but the touch screen is good also."
"3391","it is extremely hard to use. the slightly touch will change the page and it is hard to get it back"
"3392","Too dark! Amazon, please brighten this up. It's too late for me, I already bought the darn thing."
"3393","Perfect for outside."
"3394","Its freaking awesome"
"3395","Love it on the beach"
"3396","Suitable for reading"
"3397","Maybe I have been spoiled by my KINdle Keyboard but I find thst navigating thid deice is harder."
"3398","The device is a handy size and very readable both indoor and outdoor. Very happy with this gift."
"3399","The most pleasant reading experience that's not paper. Excellent word-touch definitions feature."
"3400","Didn't realize it would have ads for screensavers, but otherwise I'm perfectly happy with it."
"3401","Wish I could turn off the ads for 'special offers!' other than that, great. very thin and light."
"3402","love my kindle.  Like that I can not only buy books, but can borrow them from the Amazon library"
"3403","#lovingIt got it as a gift and I haven't been able to put it down. Love how simple it is to ise"
"3404","It's little. It's lovely. It doesn't light but that's ok. I'm very happy with it just as it is."
"3405","I love it. I thought my first kindle was outstanding, but im really enjoying my updated version"
"3406","I bought this Kindle to replace my old, beloved Kindle 2, which was dropped and damaged beyond repair. The new unit is great! The screen is the same size as the old Kindle, but it's overall much smaller, since the keyboard function is now ""on screen"". I never used the headphone jack, or the spoken word function, so I don't miss those at all. Battery life is excellent, and I prefer e-ink to backlit readers. The purchase also included one month of free Amazon Prime, so it was a good buy.. Another new touch is a choice of several fonts, along with the usual text size options. Wi-fi reception is very strong, downloading books smooth and simple. Thanks!"
"3407","We like it very much."
"3408","Love it, easy to use."
"3409","The gift was enjoyed."
"3410","I just love my Kindle"
"3411","Won best gift giver !"
"3412","I love the kindle reader. I have had kindle's since 2009 and would not leave home without one."
"3413","I bought this as a replacement for my original Kindle, the one with the keyboard on the bottom, and no touch screen.  I must admit, I am old fashioned and like the original to this iteration.  Still, after figuring out the touch screen, my new Kindle still is easy to read, one-handed, and light enough to carry anywhere.  No back light, but no problem.  I love this product."
"3414","Best e reader around."
"3415","very wonderful device"
"3416","I love my new Kindle."
"3417","The background was gray with black lettering. Unless you are in bright light, foggedaboudit."
"3418","Though it has no light unlike paperwhite. But if you are on a budget, this is a good choice."
"3419","This is my third Kindle. I am disappointed in the new “advanced” kindle. I was very happy with the old one as I was able to turn it on without having to go on line with their  advertisements. I find that I am recharging the unit after only a few days. The old one would last weeks before I needed a charge. I find that somehow when I attempt to go to the next page I am reading the next chapter and have a hard time trying to get back to where I was. To the CEO of Amazon “If it’s not broke don’t fix it!!”."
"3420","This thing has kept a charge for 2 months and I read for 2 hours on it every night. AMAZING"
"3421","better than I thought"
"3422","Very pleased with it."
"3423","It's wonderful.  And when I needed customer service I received some of the best I have had."
"3424","Perfect for my needs."
"3425","Love it. I recommend  readers to buy . Save time and money with the Kindle glare. Trust me"
"3426","I purchased three books,  A bible and two other books.  I can't  seem  to open the bible."
"3427","Very suitable product"
"3428","It was a nice present"
"3429","Easy to use, love it!"
"3430","Love it.  Worksngreat"
"3431","Light no glare. Great"
"3432","Difficult to navigate"
"3433","Love the smaller size"
"3434","Was so disappointed I returned it.  I had seen one of the Paperwhites and liked it but did not know that none of the other kindles had a back light making it too difficult for me read without eye strain, also couldn't believe they are all only black & white display.  On a positive note the touchscreen is really nice and easy to use.I decided to replace it with a Kindle HD so I could have both the back lit screen and color for a little more money.  Hope it turns out to be a better investment."
"3435","Works great, this model has no headphone jack which was weird since older model did have"
"3436","I'm in love with it!♡"
"3437","I like the way you can read outside and not have to twist and turn to what you reading."
"3438","Use it everyday to read novels and review my notes from college. Well worth the money!"
"3439","This refurbished kindle truly is ""like new"". I would definitely buy one again."
"3440","Great investment and, please protect your eyes from reading on comp. Buy this, please."
"3441","extremely light, kind of wish it had a small backlight, but that's a different product"
"3442","Too sensitive.  If you move your finger the wrong way, you create a problem.  I had to continually shut down and start up again.  This happened to me over and over,  I couldn't just sit down and read.  Very disappointed in this type of e-reader.  I had the old type before and I loved it but unfortunately lost it.  I have sent this one back."
"3443","Easy reading… lightweight, compact, take with you anywhere. My kids throughly enjoy their reads!!!"
"3444","Ireally don't know how to use it or order books after i learn how to use it everything will be ok"
"3445","Can't live without it"
"3446","Perfect for my needs."
"3447","Everything was great!"
"3448","I love my Kindle so much that I got this one for my son's 10th birthday. He loves it."
"3449","Perfect for all the reading I do at home or away. New books in seconds ready to read."
"3450","As an old kindle user I buy it because of its higher capacity and paper white display"
"3451","I bought this to read some PDF reference books, it's good for reading novels but not good for reference books. I am disappointed because it's not showing clear screen prints you need to blow up the screen to read this screen prints which takes time and also not found comfortable. I found it's too small, font size are good readable but little bigger fonts will do good."
"3452","Wonderful product, coming from someone who swore they'd only read hard book copies!!"
"3453","Was very happy with it"
"3454","I love the ease of it."
"3455","Its good for reading.."
"3456","Exactly what I wanted,"
"3457","I ordered 3 of these and gave two to my grandchildren. I like the parental control feature very much."
"3458","Thank goodness for the glare-free screen for a reader with very light sensitive eyes"
"3459","It's very touchy. You tap the screen and it acts like it's going to squelch up. Also, as the daylight fades and you're not around a light source, you can't read anymore because you need a backlight to see it."
"3460","I'm still learning how to use the Kindle reader, but so far I'm very happy with it."
"3461","love it, great present"
"3462","Enjoying reading on it"
"3463","Just great, I love it."
"3464","Love every part of it!"
"3465","makes reading more fun"
"3466","First year of having the Kindle Fire is great! I really enjoyed it and made full use of its potential, but after the first year it went downhill. The battery life became shorter, as in every other hour I had to plug the kindle onto the charger. Wasn't too bad since there are outlets where I normally sit, but then it got worse. It started powering down when it hit a certain point, normally this is good, it saves power and keeps it from totally dying, but what makes it bad is that it started powering down automatically at 30%, then 40%, then 45%. It continued on until I got absolutely fed up with it, this morning I read on it for around 2 hours when the charge hits 70%. And it powers down. These Kindles are not designed for long term use, they are designed to last until the next ""New and Improved"" model comes out with a bigger price tag. Which will overall do the same thing. I would advise those thinking about getting a tablet to get a surface or an Ipad instead of a Kindle fire, they will milk you of your money on all of the new models and you will get the same headaches out of it. All they do is add more bells and whistles."
"3467","Really like the Kindle, should have got one sooner.  Have to buy the wife one now."
"3468","This by far better than than the previous kindle. I gave it to my wife but I have the kindle white with lighted background which is wonderful..Only thing bad was that Amazon charged shipping when over $35 should be free."
"3469","Awesome little reader."
"3470","Very satisfied so far."
"3471","I live the lightness, the size, and the ease of operating. I sure don't like seeing an ad for a book everytime I open it up...I miss the long ago authors from the early Kindles. That is the only thing keeping me from giving it a five star rating."
"3472","I have a question about this product (not a review) which I am hoping someone who has bought this particular type of kindle could clarify for me. I'm thinking of buying one in order to use it to read scholarly articles that I have to read for college, rather than always printing them out or staring at them on a computer screen. These articles are invariably in pdf format, and I often litter them with notes and highlighting marks. Can this type of kindle view pdf's in an easy way? And does it allow you to take notes and to highlight on pdf files? Also, would it be easy for me to look at the notes I made on the kindle on a computer later, by maybe emailing the file to myself or something?I really appreciate any insight on this as it would be nearly the sole reason for me buying a kindle, so it's obviously important the kindle has such a capability."
"3473","Got this for the wife. She loves it. Battery lasts in an insane amount of time."
"3474","kindle is great. purchase of adapter is ripoff and an unnecessary inconvenience"
"3475","Wish screen was bigger"
"3476","its a wonderful gadget"
"3477","the screen is so small"
"3478","I love it. That's all."
"3479","Can't live without it."
"3480","I am enjoying my 6"" kindle Very much..Small, compact, easy to read…Love it!"
"3481","It has the same cheap plug in at the base as my other kindle.  No matter how careful you are over time they may bend or break.  So my other kindle that I had less then two years can't be charged.  I wonder how long before the plug in in this kindle will last it should be made of stronger or better materials.  As for the screen and the other kindle features, they are great."
"3482","Small and light weight, perfect for a ride on a plane or sitting at the beach."
"3483","Excellent product! Easy to carry around and very handy with all nice features."
"3484","Lightweight, good contrast between print and background.  More complete basic directions on how to operate touchscreen (disappearing icons when text is on screen and inability to look at manual to determine how to exit text and return to home was a problem for me)  Luckily my daughter dropped by to visit and figured out how to swipe back to home. Thought this version would be comparable to my earlier Kindle purchased many years ago.  Probably would have bought an advanced version had I done more research on this model."
"3485","The Kindle works well."
"3486","Little small but nice."
"3487","Exactly what I needed."
"3488","Lightweight. No glare."
"3489","Excellent. Great price"
"3490","This Kindle is so much litter than my other older Kindle.  I love this one!!"
"3491","Love my Kindle & especially having a free 30-day trial for Kindle unlimited."
"3492","I really like the Kindle. The only problem was, I didn't know I needed WI-FI"
"3493","I ordered the old model specifically because I was hoping to find the ""text-to-speech"" function like the former versions used to have, but no! No Text-to-speech, no mini-jack. It's gone from this model too. Why? Please Amazon, put it back on your upcoming Kindles."
"3494","Still loving Kindle. I have purchased two so far and take them every where."
"3495","Very nice kindle, easy to use and handle,easy on the eyes, I really like it"
"3496","I enjoy the interface!"
"3497","In love with my kindle"
"3498","I ordered for a friend"
"3499","Can't live without it."
"3500","I would get the White."
"3501","My son loves it. Great to help him focus on just reading. Worth every cent."
"3502","My luddite of a wife likes it, but still won't let go of her deprecated tree-based readers.  I'm sure not going to move that hoard of paper for her. I just read on my phone because the 'always have it on me' convenience beats the comfort of an e-paper display.  If i didn't have an iPhone then I'd definitely want one of these for myself."
"3503","I love it. Enough said"
"3504","My daughter loves it!!"
"3505","Screen is very touchy."
"3506","I love my Kindle!!!!!!"
"3507","Had original Kindle.This is great.Use read books newspapers an magazine ."
"3508","Easy to use. If I had any questions, the kindle manual is very thorough."
"3509","Love it!  Thought it should come with an electrical outlet cord, though."
"3510","very good but not work"
"3511","Good deal, good price."
"3512","I do like the cover for my Kindle but had hoped it had a prop of some kind so I could read it without holding it some time. Not necessary but a p,us. Otherwise am p,ease with the structure and how light it is."
"3513","Love it!!  It's my first step away from paper and I can't put it down!!"
"3514","I love it simple as that, this is the best investment I have ever made."
"3515","very convenient and easy to use. great for travel is light and compact."
"3516","It is rreally great .  I am still learning all the  new ways to use it."
"3517","Excellent it's perfect."
"3518","Great for reading brail"
"3519","Enjoying its great deal"
"3520","This productwas not what I thought it would be. I was a little disapointed. next time I will know better."
"3521","horrible to use.  why is there advertisements on the screen when you turn it off?  I didn't buy it to see anything but the books I want to read.  Have lots of trouble with the swiping and touching to operate this Kindle.  Had one of the first Kindles that had actual buttons for typing in things, not a touch screen.  It worked great for many years.  I hope I can get rid of this one and find one of the older ones.  The old one was hooked up to the whisper net anywhere I went, no logging on or needing passwords.  Sorry I purchased this thing.  Maybe I can give it to my grandkids, they will probably be able to use it better than me."
"3522","we hate it I have an older one from 2 or 3 years ago and like it much better. we are returning this one."
"3523","Way to much to work around. Just want to read.liked my 2nd one better."
"3524","I am use to reading on the iPad and wanted something I could use outside.  As I was just looking for a reader I bought the least expensive which turns out has ads and all annoying things forcing you to review a book you hadn't read yet.  Learning to get around this, but right now I would say I amnot pleased with the reading experience.  Perhaps as I read more I will learn to like it.  It doesn't even give you the number of pages or number left in a chapter.  Other than a percentage  you have no idea where you are.  I won't recommend this to a friend or maybe the more expensive versions are better."
"3525","When the ad said ""built in wi-fi"" I thought it was like my first Kindle.  I am not near wi-fi sometimes and would like to be able to download books anywhere.  The Kindle Fire I bought was just a pain to use.  This battery life seems to last longer.  Like the glare-free screen. Wish for my first Kindle every day.  I won't buy another Kindle."
"3526","I enjoy it but need backlit lighting for nighttime reading (this is an inexpensive item for electronics) also amazon could increase the cost to 89 ,looking back I would have bought the paperwhite that has this (and many more benefits ) I am a harsh grader so a 3 star is equal to an average person's 4 . Hope this helps!!"
"3527","A simple Kindle reading device which works great for daytime reading."
"3528","This is a great KIndle."
"3529","Love it.  It is so easy to use , very compact fits in my pocketbook."
"3530","My 9 year old loves it!"
"3531","Simple and easy to use. Love the landscape option for reading in bed"
"3532","I am now able to read on the go!  I would recommend it to my friends"
"3533","Somewhat hard to set-up"
"3534","Happy with my purchase."
"3535","Simply the best e-Reader you can get. No ifs ands or buts about it!"
"3536","it's works well outside"
"3537","Very good, no problems."
"3538","At m\y reach constantly"
"3539","Very nice but now I see I should have bought the one with a light."
"3540","Very happy with product"
"3541","Love it! Live Amazon.  Thanks to my kids for getting me the Kindle"
"3542","Love it! I can read outside now which I couldn't do on my tablet."
"3543","I would like to have it"
"3544","Very nice for the price"
"3545","Love love my kindle!!!!"
"3546","Excellent, no backlight"
"3547","Excellent product. I'm a person who enjoy to read and this is prefect to do that. It's like a book. Perfect"
"3548","This was too complicated to get started.  I finally had to call my Wi-Fi provider to get it up and running."
"3549","I'm very happy with it."
"3550","GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE"
"3551","Love the possibilities."
"3552","Amazon was kind enough to let me return this Kindle. Their excellent customer service is appreciated very much. Because they understood how poor a quality this version of the Kindle was, and provided a refund, I am a devoted Amazon shopper. Pass on this Kindle. It is too difficult to see the display."
"3553","best thing I've ever bought.  use it constantly all day long."
"3554","I had an earlier model Kindle, with the buttons instead of the touch screen, and I liked the earlier one better.  The touch screen is not always responsive, especially when switching from portrait to landscape mode (which is not as easy), and there does not seem to be any way to control some things ... like, do I really need to be paused in using my Kindle because it is downloading a new Chinese character set?  Please!"
"3555","great. got it for cheap."
"3556","much easier for me to read books on then on the Kindle Fire."
"3557","Love it! So far so good!"
"3558","An archaic device. The screen was so dark, we could hardly read in the dark--one of the main reasons for an electronic reading device versus a real book. No brightness adjusters. Super pixelated. I felt like a black-and-white PacMan was going to jump on the screen and start eating the words.... Needless to say, this device is with UPS and back on its way to Amazon. Might try another version. But for now, I'll pull a book from the shelf."
"3559","Purchased to replace an older keyboard kindle that died. While this one is smaller & lighter, I still prefer the older model. Another bad mark is that you cannot download games to it. The older one could. But for reading only it's fine."
"3560","Not one to write reviews but you should be warned! My girl is 11. This kindle makes her read more, it's awesome. I want to give 5 stars. However, when the device is shut off ads pop up. Found a very provocative one for 50 Shades of Grey on my little girls Kindle. Not happy. I'm sure even younger kids own these. If you are going to advertise on these things they should be age friendly for everybody. Not cool Amazon"
"3561","I sent it back because I didn't realize I couldn't use it without a light. I ordered the paperwhite instead."
"3562","Didn't realize it was so small, although I should have looked at size.  Advantage, you can read in daylight."
"3563","I thought there might be some pre-loaded books on there for that price and you do have to spend another $20 for a rubberized-skin to hold it firmly, they could have put that in the design...just another way to grab $20 off you, but you can read it in the sun which is a big plus"
"3564","THIS KINDLE IS GREAT MAKES READING PICTURE PERFECT TO READ."
"3565","works great for reading!"
"3566","It's awesome. I love it!"
"3567","Easy to use and download"
"3568","My wife and I love this!"
"3569","Love! Perfect for travel"
"3570","Gave this as a gift to my mom and she loves it! Just be aware there is NO BACK LIGHT.  You cannot use this device if there is poor lighting due to this issue.  Also it did not come with any instructions so I needed to utilize a youtube video to figure out how to change the size of the font."
"3571","Love it - just wanted a simple e reader and this is it !!"
"3572","Very good reading device"
"3573","love my kindle thank you"
"3574","If you load your kindle with a book series good luck figuring out which one to read first unless it's clearly marked on the book cover. I have had a kindle from 1st gen to paperwhite & now this and I have to say I regret buying it. With the other kindle's I was able to do collections on the device and edit metadata via Calibre so I could easily determine reading order. Not with the software on this device. If I make a collection I cannot even find it on the device!I had a Nook HD+ and several tablets that were easier to use. I'm really disappointed and I never thought I'd say that about a Kindle. Ever."
"3575","Exactly what I expected!"
"3576","Awesome!!!! A x'mas gift for a friend and she loves it."
"3577","It still has glare when I'm trying to read at the gym."
"3578","Easy to set up and read."
"3579","I really like my kindle."
"3580","Love this. Perfect size!"
"3581","I am enjoying my Kindle!"
"3582","I really like it. I have the Kindle reading app on my laptop and several books already. It's nice to be able to have something smaller to take with me to read with. If I would have known, I might have bought the one with the back-light. But for $59, it was worth it. I only gave it four stars because I bought it at Staples on sale. It had a $20 instant rebate (and a $30 Staples card) so it was $59. Later, I discovered the $20 was a promotional deal with Amazon to put ads on it as screensavers, etc. To get them off, you have to pay the $20 bucks. I can live with it, but I think it should have been spelled out that the $20 instant rebate was a promotional deal. I never had an instant rebate come with strings!"
"3583","Exactly what I wanted :)"
"3584","Won't turn on... waste."
"3585","Perfect for my daughter."
"3586","the battery is dead after one year and a half. Why ?"
"3587","this works great for me."
"3588","Great reading experience"
"3589","Description was unclear."
"3590","Awesome service. Thanks!"
"3591","Love it. Finally got one"
"3592","Works well, no problems."
"3593","I can now read outside when I'm working at the pool!"
"3594","I do like the glare free screen, however I don't like the fact that I can not read on it in a dark room.  Since I do most of my reading at night in bed, this really isnot a great fit for me, hence three stars.  I also prefer the black background and white text I get on my other Kindle!  I have vision problems and can see better in that mode.  I do however like the light weight and the touch screen!  Add a night light and option to change the background and text color and you will successfully earn five stars!"
"3595","After two days with the Kindle I make a brief overview:+Good price+Good Display with sunlight+Good Viewing in low light+Good answer to last page+Very little to envy to a real book-Materials something weak construction-Slow start system-Screen Need 3 more inches, and a smaller frame.-It should include a free dictionary at least"
"3596","Exceeded my expectations."
"3597","I don't need anything fancy. Just a great, reliable, non-glare e-reader with great battery life. Simple and sweet."
"3598","DO NOT BUY A KINDLE! Their customer service is a helpless call center in India, they lie, barely speak English and have no authority to help you. My amazon account got hacked; hackers changed my email associated with my account and kindle. Amazon now refuses to transfer my bought books to my new amazon account. They were very helpful to to protect themselves from fraud when I reported it. Afterwards, no help with my kindle whatsoever. I have called their call center 10 times, spent hours. My kindle is now a paperweight. Go elsewhere!"
"3599","Still getting to my Kindle. I bought the less expensive model to make sure I would use it and enjoy it. Which I do so I'm wondering if amazon allows trade ins? How awesome that would be. Win win situation."
"3600","Great reader. Wait for it to go back down to $59.99"
"3601","I am enjoying this Kindle and the price was right!!"
"3602","Super, just love the fact that it is only a reader."
"3603","still working on some things to make it more for me"
"3604","Kindle is kindle, the correct price and performance"
"3605","It bothers me that on my old paper white I could change the brightness but not on this thing and it bugs me because I like to read in the dark right before bed and I can't do that if I can't see the words"
"3606","While I love my kindle I am not happy about a recent (as in today) development-I am  receiving a system warning that I am low on memory.  I have 675 books on my kindle.  The system capacity is supposed to be thousands.  Not 675.  I now how to delete content from my kindle.Color me a bit disappointed."
"3607","Wish it came with a light"
"3608","Great just what I needed!"
"3609","Easy to use! Light weight"
"3610","The title explains it all"
"3611","Thank you love my Kindle!"
"3612","This kindle is not backlit so I can't read in bed. This wasn't clear in the description and I didn't read reviews because I was being ""timed"" (purchased during the special prime sale). My other kindle stopped recharging so I couldn't borrow my one book a month. Now I can borrow a book, but I can't read at bedtime. Still prefer reading on my iPad."
"3613","Great glare free reading."
"3614","Hard to read in low light"
"3615","Good but could be better."
"3616","Books are to expansive!!!"
"3617","For the money, its great."
"3618","Good but not as I thought"
"3619","Don't care for this kindle as much as I did my old one.  Several games I really liked is not compatible to this device.  Also can not turn off the wifi (or I can't figure how too).  Maybe I'll become more accustom to it over time."
"3620","Very good reader. No glare and easy on the eyes."
"3621","it is everything I wanted"
"3622","Love the white background"
"3623","Very good value for money"
"3624","Excellent for reading outside in the bright sun."
"3625","I am totally hooked on the Kindle ap. It is on my IPad, IPhone and Kindle Fire. They are all up date together so I never loose my place in my book. The Kindle Fire is old and now dying so I thought to replace it. This version of the Kindle is horrible. It is basically a tablet to read advertisments. You have to wade through all the advertisments to finally find the book you are reading. I buy atleast 6 kindle books a months I don't think I should have to be subjected to advertisements. I wouldn't recommend this as your primary reading product it is small and black and white and quite frankly you would be better off with the book and much cheaper!"
"3626","Greatest product I have ever bought in my life!"
"3627","I am naturally an avid reader. This reader is distracting with its inconveniences. I bought this for my grand daughter. I am in setup process. This product seems to be in black and white only. The color book jackets are uninteresting. It is not at all easy to read. Lack of backlight makes it very difficult to read even in a brightly lit room. The text is very hard to read. I don't see this reader inspiring my grand daughter to read."
"3628","I am enjoying the Kindle."
"3629","Very east to read and use"
"3630","Perfect for just reading!"
"3631","Love it, Love it, Love it"
"3632","Such a convenient gadget! Great functionality!"
"3633","I  love it  I wish there was a charger with it"
"3634","Disappointed that instructional content failed to get packed into the cute little box.  It would have served well to have even the most rudimentary instructions on such things as how to fire the thing up.  AND, how to turn it off.  The little button was finally spotted hiding under the lower edge, but had no idea what the lights mean.  In other words, I felt this was a rushed sale to push something out the door.  No apparent concern for the hapless buyer.Still not able to use the thing wisely or efficiently, since I have scant time to devote lengthy time to deciphering all the hidden charms.  Hopefully in time it may come together for me."
"3635","I love it. It's size and weight are perfect and the font size adjustment is great.  The only thing I would like to have, is the ability to listen to my books from Audible.com.  Thank you for a great product!"
"3636","An AWESOME  deal on an AWESOME product! I  love my Kindle! Now, let me say that my Kindle is not this one, but the previous basic version. At the current sale price, this better model costs the same as my old one did! Anyone who wants to by their Mom (or any other avid reader they love) a fabulous ""gift that keeps on giving"", should seriously consider buying them a Kindle, & with this special offer, NOW IS THE TIME! (PS ~ I'm hoping my kids will see this & buy me a Touch for Mom's Day!)  ;-D"
"3637","This is my 3rd Kindle and I love it.  MUCH better than the previous models I have although I loved them also.  Really like the touch screen and LOVE the built in lite.  I take mine on week long fishing trips on big boats and love to read at nite when we're traveling, used to struggle to see the old ones with marginal lighting in the rooms.  The new model needs NO light for great visability at nite and the screen is much more readable.If you're a Kindle owner, you owe it to yourself to upgrade,And I LOVE buying my books from Amazon, the reviews help me make decisions and the samples help with new authors."
"3638","An amazing device. A different experience.The dictionary and Wikipedia feature is noteworthy. Money well spent."
"3639","I am enjoying the kindle."
"3640","Item is just as expected."
"3641","Great, cheap, easy to use"
"3642","easy to use and  reliable"
"3643","Received as a gift and waited too long to try it so it can't be returned. I'm not a fan of the whole concept of reading devices. Yes, there are advantages—there are also disadvantages. Even the smallest text size has me turning pages constantly. It's not as bright as I'd like. Library books have too short a borrow time. Having to wait to 'check-out' library ebooks strikes me as absurd. Of the titles I searched in the library, 9 of 10 had unspecified wait times. Most others (especially popular authors) aren't available through the library system and can only be purchased. Amazon's Prime lending library is, in my opinion, all but useless and simply a promotion for sales of anything current you might like to read."
"3644","Great screen. Customized settings available."
"3645","No frills, but a good budget friendly Kindle"
"3646","Love my Kindle. lol!!!!!!!"
"3647","a++"
"3648","My daughter has fallen in love with reading."
"3649","Not like a paperwhite.  I like to read by the pool and usually use a ziplock bag to protect the device.  The touchscreen is too sensitive and goes crazy when it's in the bag.  Not as usable as I'd hoped."
"3650","Exactly what I wanted, needed and expected."
"3651","Great. Quite happy with it"
"3652","Items purchased as a gift."
"3653","Having great fun learning how to use this!"
"3654","I didn't realize I was buying the touchscreen version, I thought I was just getting the most basic version. I liked the non-touch screen version because my stupid friends always touch my kindle to try and mess me up. Now they will succeed. But it's still a Kindle and therefore gets stars. I love kindles. I keep breaking them but I love them"
"3655","I was replacing a Kindle Paper White and thought that this was the same thing. It was cheap and that's nice but I wish I had known that it isn't back lit. It is fairly useless without good light which means reading at night I have to have lots of lights on rather than just one where I'm sitting. It came to my email as a promotional sale and it looks exactly like the Paper White in the picture. Oh well, Kindles are inexpensive as a trade off for a non-repairable short lived reader. My next reader will definately be an android tablet that can read all formats and has a bigger screen."
"3656","It no longer has whispernet which the rep did not tell me on the phone. The plastic perimeter was soiled immediately with the oils from my hands. And frankly I find it harder to use than my prior two kindles. Thinking about returning it."
"3657","A nice, workhorse type reader.  No glare!"
"3658","Great value for the price!"
"3659","Really great for the price"
"3660","i have had this kindle now for a very long time and it has never given me any trouble at all,i am now looking to buy a kindle hd fire my grand chrildren have them and they love it it gives them films to watch and games lots of games they are all very quite for a change,i am so  glad my daugter has brought them one each it makes visting them a nice and quite ,change from being very noisy and shouting at each other,why do little girls scream,not any more,thanks kindle fire hd."
"3661","It was a gift, and it was well received."
"3662","Perfect!! Received faster than expected."
"3663","My kindle (which I loved!) is now not working! Screen shows the advertising but wont respond to touch. I ordered it on August 2nd, and it being September 10th (outside the 30 day window) makes it that much harder to return if I am able to at all--I took a chance on ""refurbished"" and I will not try any of these ""refurbished"" aka quit after 1 month and 8 day  items again :/"
"3664","Perfect! Love my kindle :)"
"3665","Great for reading outside."
"3666","Great for daytime reading!"
"3667","Very easy to read eccept in dim light!"
"3668","Excellent value for money."
"3669","absolutely love it! delivered on time"
"3670","Having problems with screen freeze up"
"3671","Love it!!! Thanks, Amazon!"
"3672","love it, I can't be without a Kindle."
"3673","It met up to expectations."
"3674","Different than my first Kindle, glare-free screen is great but hard to relearn  how to access some of the settings.  I was told all the books in my first Kindle would automatically be transferred to the new one as soon as it is registered, never happened.  Also my favorite game ""Every Word"" is evidently not compatible with it.  Extremely disappointed, guess I should have paid for a better upgrade but then it may not have worked either.  I just expected everything to be there when I registered this device.  I absolutely loved my first Kindle and had it for three and a half years with no complaints but it finally quit.  This is not the same!"
"3675","This stays charged forever"
"3676","Love it!  Very easy to use and read!"
"3677","I am very happy with my new Kendal."
"3678","slow start but we are getting there"
"3679","Great and very convenient."
"3680","Love these little tablets."
"3681","Does exactly what it says."
"3682","Good product and packaging"
"3683","Love it! And the right size for me!"
"3684","Very light and easy to carry around"
"3685","Not too bad screen isn't glare free"
"3686","Perfect for reading books you love!"
"3687","This kindle provides great reads as all Kindles do . The glare free screen is much easier on senior eyesand works well with my other Kindles as far as syncing . The battery life and storage capacity are a bonus as well.All in all makes for a enjoyable experience"
"3688","A nice product. It definitely gives a feel of real book. There are few drawbacks though. It does not support rotation so that wider view can be used with bigger font. The font-size is too small for me. When font size is increased, it does not support scrolling to the next page."
"3689","Yes! I love it I only wish I was able to read it in the dark! But I purchased a light to attach to mine and I'm all good now!"
"3690","Worked for an entire week."
"3691","this thing does NOT read to me as advertised~ i thought it would work with my audibles account (also provided by amazon) what good is this if i actaully have to read it myself!? who comes up with this stuff!?!?!?!  should re-name it to e-read-it-yourself not ""E-reader""that many of you got tricked by amazon and still are giving such rave reviews? wow people have REALLY gotten dumb!highly disappointed amazon!"
"3692","Very disappointed. This is my second Kindle and I would love to return it. The quality of my first Kindle was much superior to the new one. I have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone at Amazon to discuss this. If you are going to buy one buy a more expensive version."
"3693","I gave this four stars only because it doesn't have a light (but thankfully I have a bedside lamp).  I forgot this when I ordered it..  I got this only after my first Kindle got too slow for me.  I have a Fire and a Fire HDX, and I ordered the  Kindle 6"" specifically to read in bed because of it's weight (6 oz.)."
"3694","Older kindles much easier to use."
"3695","Good so far. Perfect for me"
"3696","The problem with the new Kindles is no sound.  The other changes I could live with but with poor eyes whisperlink was a wonderful gift.  These version do not list having a port for sound.  Sad."
"3697","i like the weight of the kindle, its not glare free,i think with the grayish background and if the light is not too bright it is harder to read. i also have a hard time with touch screen and get lost pressing different settings . it should have come with more info how to use the newer versioni loved my first kindle easy to operate"
"3698","I wish it was a bit bigger!"
"3699","It is very good. I like it."
"3700","Love how lightweight it is!"
"3701","LOVE IT.  Read so much now."
"3702","Love it. Very easy to read."
"3703","LOVE it! Easy to read and use :)"
"3704","My child likes it very much"
"3705","Love my Kindle! Thank you!!"
"3706","Love it for reading at the beach"
"3707","Love it, just what I wanted"
"3708","Best reading experience without eyestrain on a technological device. Must have for reading web articles, blog postings, books, etc. Very easy to carry on one hand while reading. They should increase the storage capacity of device."
"3709","Absolutely love this device"
"3710","Great product at a GREAT price!"
"3711","Wonderful.  So glad I have one."
"3712","Perfect for outdoor reading"
"3713","Really enjoying my Kindle!!"
"3714","Very happy with this Kindle"
"3715","Very nice and a great price"
"3716","working great, doing great!"
"3717","As expected, great product!"
"3718","Love it! Battery life is great!"
"3719","I really enjoy the reading."
"3720","i  bought this kindle for my wife but now can not order any books for my kindle they all go to hers also the instructions are terrible to follow how do i get books to my kindle????"
"3721","I still can't believe that Amazon put the name ""Kindle "" on this item.  I bought it to replace my original keyboard Kindle that had quit working.  I wish so badly that I could have replaced it with the same model.  If I had only one word to describe this item,  it's ""plastic ""Okay I have to touch on screen quality,  or lack thereof,  I was so disappointed.  I can't believe that Kindle has been reduced to this."
"3722","I would have rather had a Kindle fire but it's  a reader and that's what I do most with it....the Kindle fire was on sale a few days after I purchased mine for $10 dollars more than I paid for mine ... wish I would have gotten that instead but I'm ok with that"
"3723","tricky to learn how to use."
"3724","Can read in bright sunlight"
"3725","Lightweight and easy to use"
"3726","the kindle is a great product."
"3727","I'm really disappointed with this Kindle. I used to own a paper white but it froze solid after 15 months of use. I bought this one because it was less money and I read a lot of eBooks. The display is very dark and hard to read.  I'll try to sell it or give it away. It's also slightly heavier than the paper white."
"3728","Can't access novels bought on amazonI have now been able to access books not purchased on Amazon.  It is difficult to reade and recall all the directions for the use of the Kindle.  Could a hard copy be sent to me?"
"3729","My 2nd Keep Kindle good stuff"
"3730","Very easy to use, thank you"
"3731","Amazing, my kids love them!"
"3732","recipient really liked this"
"3733","great device, my kids love it"
"3734","I bought because of the price"
"3735","its better than my old reader"
"3736","so far so good. it looks sleek. But one thing I don't like is why kindles come in so many different sizes! this one doesn't fit into the cover for previous generations of Kindle. So the cover I bought for 59.99 is all for nothing! Also you can't even find a cover that fits this with light while this device doesn't come with light!!!"
"3737","Am returning this one, The screen is way too small and without a back light, I can't even see the print on it, It may be useful for someone who rides public transportation and can sit next to a window to have enough natural light to read by, however I would not even be able to use this. I like the concept for people who travel, airplanes and such to have an endless reading supply, however most of the books available that I could see where not my cup of tea.. will wait until readers evolve more to try again."
"3738","Loved my first Gen Kindle and was hesitant to upgrade to a touchscreen, but I LOVE this! Much easier to use the functions without having to use the scroll functions."
"3739","Love reading. It's amazing."
"3740","it is an excelente product!"
"3741","I use it everyday. I love t"
"3742","A little hard to figure out"
"3743","I guess I either didn't pay attention to the description or am ignorant of Kindle's capabilities, but I am very disappointed that this Kindle doesn't light up. Although it's hands down better than the IPad in the sun, I'm unhappy to know I spent money on something that is useless at night."
"3744","It would have helped to have received some directions on how to use the Kindle, like I had received with the original Kindle I had. As it is, I haven't used this new replacement since I've received it"
"3745","Easier to see in all lights!"
"3746","My sister in law loved this!"
"3747","I hate it. I loathe it.  It makes me want to abandon Kindle all together.  Whenever they ""improve"" something it means improve shareholders' share, not the customer's experience!  They took away text-to-speech previously.  Now they took away the little plug on the side to insert in the protecting folder that had a built in light.The device feels like cheap, $1 Chinese plastic. (Compared to the slick sheen feel of the previous keyboard version).  The touch screen is so ""touchy"" that it turns the page if you sneeze (literally, I'm not kidding!!!).  And the frame is so narrow that you can barely avoid touching the screen, therefore inadvertently advancing (or rewinding) the page.Disgusting, cheap crap.  I might need to go back to the library and have real books.  Thanks for NOTHING Amazon Kindle!! Phew!!!"
"3748","This product is very misleading as all other Kindles had the back and forward buttons on the side so you can use one hand to turn the pages but this one does not.  Better to have my older second generation unit than this newer one."
"3749","i like my new kindle <3"
"3750","very nice just as described"
"3751","Great product for the price"
"3752","It's a Kindle - says it all"
"3753","Unable to adjust the light."
"3754","Great product for the price"
"3755","I like it bc it is so light"
"3756","Is there any Kindle READER only that has the text to speech like the older one with the keyboard has?????  I have that one and would love to buy a new READER but I use that feature often.  Seems like they added new features BUT left off some too.  What a shame!"
"3757","Very happy with my kindle !"
"3758","I love my kindle paperwhite, I love the small size and light weight. I recommend it to anyone that lives to read. It is easier to slip into a purse or coat pocket than a paperback book. Thanks for another outstanding product!"
"3759","I think the Kindle is all that it was advertised to be, but there were no instructions with it. I am still trying to figure it out."
"3760","Product is fine, however, it auto subscribe you as a Prime membership and charged you USD99 even though you have cancel the subscription before the month end free trial ! Can't find a way to feedback yet"
"3761","It is light weight so I can carry it with me where ever I go. I am in school online so it has become a very valuable tool to me."
"3762","This is Kindle is terrible... I can't see the screen even in a well lit room and I have better than perfect eyesight... and forget reading a book at night... I'm returning... not at all what I anticipated... much different than my other Kindle... now I have to return this!"
"3763","This is the first tablet/reader I've ever purchased, and while I won't pretend to be tech savvy, I kind of regret purchasing This item.  No light....so I can't even read without a normal lamp; does not come with a charger ; and is only capable of displaying reading material...nothing more.  I guess I got what I paid for, But definitely not thrilled with my purchase."
"3764","Easy to use for reading only"
"3765","In  love with my new Kindle."
"3766","I find this kindle much heavier in weight than previous model. Also less easy to use. I have yet to figure out how to adjust my screen for easier viewing. ALSO MY PREVOUSLY READ BOOKS do no show they were actually read before. So I have to open the book, to see if finished or not.The screen does not respond to touch readily either. Numerous times, I am trying to go to the ""home"" page, and it will not respond.  I wish my old one was still working."
"3767","Love reading it like a book."
"3768","Just got it so far its been fantastic and it works with my Linux OS, now begins the cavalcade-ing tsunami of e-books that I can now read anywhere!  :)"
"3769","As expected.. Great product."
"3770","Much better than the Fire."
"3771","Thank you for everything.."
"3772","My kids love our new Kindle!"
"3773","HAD FOR 3 WEEKS, WORKS GREAT"
"3774","Easy to read and convenient."
"3775","This is absolutely a great product. The battery life is great. The screen size is perfect; I worried it would be too small, but it's great. Very happy with all the awesome features. Highly recommend."
"3776","For the price, this is a great reader. Perfect for what I needed it for, reading. Much improved from prior generations of readers. Only thing I would have liked is the light that paperwhite provides."
"3777","Absolutely love this Kindle. The size is better to carry in my handbag, so I have it whenever I have spare time to read. In fact, It is much lighter to hold when reading in bed. It is PERFECT for me!"
"3778","Easy to use, I only use it for reading so I did not require one of the other units.  I had my other Kindle for about 4 years and the battery just did not hold the charge for long.  Great replacement."
"3779","First Kindle ever.  Love it."
"3780","Nice sall unit to read from!"
"3781","I love my Kindle. I didn't really want something super expensive as I've had bad luck with Kindles in the past. However, you get a lot of bang for your buck with this model. I loved the touch screen."
"3782","absolutely LOVE my kindle :)"
"3783","Awesome!  Great for reading!"
"3784","It's really great.  Love it!"
"3785","Works well.....charges fast."
"3786","Can't beat it for the price."
"3787","Love my new Kindle!  It replaced my Kindle that was one of the first ones sold.  This one has darker font and is much lighter.  I have an iPad, but I think reading on my Kindle is easier on my eyes."
"3788","Great kindle. The only thing I wish there was is a lighting adjuster, so you are kind of limited where you can read. Anyway, very light, turns pages fast, and a pretty good e - reader! Great choice."
"3789","My only complaint is that more than one page turns at a time, sometimes, then I have to  flip back to get to the current page.  Also the turn off/on button is very small.  Other than that I LOVE IT!"
"3790","I was not sure if I would like the lok and feel of someting other than a paper book but have been surprised how much I like it. Its so easy to carry and to read at the gym or on a plane. I'm hooked!"
"3791","Lightweight and easy to use!"
"3792","Which cover fits this model?"
"3793","East to set up, easy to use."
"3794","Love it! Just what I wanted."
"3795","Bought it by mistake, keeping it because it's a good product and doesn't let me distract myself like the Fire does.  I get my reading done and can read in the sun, which you can't do with the fire."
"3796","Great battery life, love it!"
"3797","I love it! use it every day!"
"3798","I never thought that this little thing could transform reading for me. What a convenient device? Wish I would have bought one before now. It makes the reading experience so much simpler. I love it!"
"3799","It wonderful but a bit slow."
"3800","I don't like the touchscreen"
"3801","It great for my first kindle"
"3802","Very good, light reader. With the benefit of being able to go to the internet. Love the idea of emailing docs to the reader.  I would give it a 5 star if it was a little bigger. Great value at $50"
"3803","Easy to use, works great...."
"3804","I've said a lot about the Kindle in another review. I'll summarize what I said by saying its a great product, and I nice upgrade from the last basic model. I just wish it was a little more durable"
"3805","I am enjoying my Kindle.  I only wish I had gotten the one with the back light, but that's okay.  I love that I can borrow books from the Kindle library for free, too! I've already read two books!"
"3806","5th kindle worth every penny"
"3807","I'm a life long book lover and didn't think I wanted a Kindle. But traveling forced my hand and I haven't stopped reading since I got it!  I look forward to waiting, lines and down time.  Love it!"
"3808","Good for reading enthusiasts"
"3809","Love the Kindle kids bundle!"
"3810","Love it can't put it down :)"
"3811","Every thing is great so far!"
"3812","I'm going to enjoy using it."
"3813","I absolutely love my Kindle."
"3814","Couldn't tell it wasn't new!"
"3815","I absolutely love my Kindle!"
"3816","Best device since my GameBoy"
"3817","great product and service"
"3818","I had one of the first Kindles for years, but it broke.  I bought this one thinking it had a backlight like my old one.  It is lightweight and small, but I must admit, I like the older one better"
"3819","Love it!  I utilize my Kindle Unlimited subscription on my Kindle.  Only drawback (which everyone but me probably knew about) is that one can't read on the Kindle at night.  Otherwise, fantastic!"
"3820","Although this kindle is very nice I was hoping it was like old one that had text to talk ability. I really like listening while I drive"
"3821","This kindle is not glare free as it is advertised.  Very difficult, almost painful to the eyes, to look at the screen because of glare."
"3822","This is my third Kindke and I love it!  This replaces Kindle 2nd edition. Need glare free screen for outside reading this is perfect!"
"3823","Was about to buy a Kindle. NO FRIGGIN WAY!!!! Digital are almost as much as the pulp edition. Seriously how many books are you reading that you can't carry two (possibly, if you're nearing the end of your first one). Like the idea, but prices are out of whack in my opinion."
"3824","Currently studying, so i was lookning to save some trees (and of course money) in prints. This was it.Perfect for reading small to medium text that you don't want to print.JpC.."
"3825","I questioned getting a Kindle for years.  Now that I made the jump I couldn't be happier.  I am reading more as it is so easy to have a book with me when I am on the train or in between meetings."
"3826","I always thought I preferred having an actual book in my hand, being able to turn the pages, etc., but I'm here to tell you, this Kindle is just as good, if not better :)  Happy with my purchase!"
"3827","I love it!! I was so excited when I got this for Christmas. My other touchscreen Kindle from about over a year ago kept freezing up on me & was so slow. This one is great & I love the glare free."
"3828","Nice size, east to handle and easy to read in. This is our 4th Kindle (replacing an early gen.2) and seems a good evolution of a simple digital reader. The price point makes it a very good value."
"3829","Love my kindle!  Perfect size"
"3830","A perfect device, weak screen"
"3831","Had to buy a kindle in order to read certain e-books. Didn't want to add more tech. to my possessions, but this item works great. For other beginners, I suggest inserting a small written manual."
"3832","It's a little hard getting used to the touch screen (versus the older Kindle that I have), but it's light weight, and easy to use. It's small size makes it really easy to take with me on the go."
"3833","I have bought several Kindle user manuals, but still do not know how to use any Kindle features. Why in the world doesn't Amazon publish a REAL user's manual so I can learn how to use my Kindle?"
"3834","It's just what I've been wanting. The amount of light is great for reading in bed without disturbing my spouse. The tutorial is excellent for getting started. I'm very pleased with this product."
"3835","I'm so happy with the Kindle."
"3836","I love this so easy to use :)"
"3837","I like it. It is very helpful"
"3838","I purchased this during Prime Day to give as a gift. Well, right out of the box - it doesn't have a charger! My friend doesn't have a computer so it's useless. I figured I could always just give her one of my leftover chargers that I had around the house but then it says you need wifi? Since when does a Kindle need wifi? My old ones don't. Back it goes"
"3839","I have one of the first generation Kindle tablets and because screen glare and late night reading was a problem at times, I thought I would try a dedicated Kindle e-reader.  In the frenzy of Amazon Prime Day, this seemed like a good deal and I readily bought it.  As soon as I tried it though, I was very disappointed.  The screen was so dim and lacked contrast that I could hardly read the page in the middle of the afternoon.  Then I was shocked to discover there's no way to adjust the screen brightness.  It has no light!  My main objective in buying this was to reduce eye strain but the strain is worse than with my old device due to its inherent dimness.  I went back and read the full description and sure enough it does disclose there is no light.  Another buyer may like it just fine but for the money, I feel this is an inferior product.  First time ever, I'm making an effort to return an item."
"3840","Excellent deal via Amazon promo, but the screen is so dark. I knew it wasn't lighted, but this is pretty dim. Ended up finding a Paperwhite on eBay for great price and it's much easier to read!"
"3841","I very much enjoy the Kindle."
"3842","Very happy with this Kindle!!"
"3843","So light and easy to read. .."
"3844","not as good as the older ones"
"3845","The screen is not stable, it fluctuates a lot while browsing. But you cannot expect much for the amount you spending. It will serve your purpose of reading books and cannot expect much from it."
"3846","I bought a Kindle reader at Staples. It was the cheapest one. About $59 if I remember correctly. I bought it 'cause it was light weight, store in a pocket, and readable screen. It didn't survive the second charge. Screen developed a 1 square inch screw up at the bottom right. Rendered every page unreadable. Piece of junk. No Stars"
"3847","Awsome, great for reading on!"
"3848","It was exactly as advertised."
"3849","seems to be working out fine."
"3850","I just ordered a second one for my 10 year old twins... I got one for my book lover, and the other asked for one also!BOOM!  What cover fits?  That's what I'm having a hard time figuring out."
"3851","I'm still getting used to the touch screen. As of right now I do miss the buttons, my page gets turned unintentionally on occasion or the text size will change, but otherwise I really like it."
"3852","not much to say except I love it :) and even though it was a small thing, I really appreciated that it was already tethered to my amazon account, so I didn't need to re-input my personal info."
"3853","In love with my kindle <3"
"3854","Easy to use and easy to read."
"3855","Love the light weight factor."
"3856","Exactly what I had hoped it would be. It's just like reading a book, and doesn't strain my eyes the way reading on my phone did. Took me a very long time to get an e-reader but I'm glad I did."
"3857","It took a few minutes to adjust to the touch screen, but I am doing well with it now. I still haven't mastered all of the options it offers, but I am getting used to it. I'm on my second book."
"3858","This kindle is so comfortable to read and move through the options.  Unfortunately I find I have to restart it every time I want to read as it doesn't turn on with a touch of the power button."
"3859","Got this to replace a Nook that started acting up. There are things that I miss about my Nook & wish I could read my EPUB books on the Kindle, but other than that, I am loving it. Easy to use."
"3860","Kindle arrived in chinese language unable to find settings to change to english, there are no instructions on how to setup when unable to read chinese, i gave this as a gift, very embarassing"
"3861","difficult to get used to the touch screen...keep getting ""home"" screen or notes...even after setting options not to...difficult to get my older stuff...navigation is not uber-friendly"
"3862","This screen is great for reading.  I have 3 kindles and I love them, but for reading this screen far surpasses all other screens.I can now enjoy reading again.  It doesn't hurt my eyes."
"3863","Love this while on the beach."
"3864","Absolutely love my new kindke"
"3865","Works fine shipped right away"
"3866","Very happy with my new kindle"
"3867","Nice and the shipping is fast"
"3868","Very readable screen.  Much better than the color screen models. It would benefit from a backlight but that isn't worth the money it costs for the upgraded version.  Everything else is great."
"3869","Although the touchscreen is a nice feature, sometimes it doesn't respond as quickly as anticipated. Overall good product, but I probably would've splurged on the Paperqhite for night reading."
"3870","This my first reader and i am really enjoying it. I like especially the ease of downloading new  e-books and being able to read then right away. The pages are very clear and easy on the eyes."
"3871","I bought this for a gift,  she absolutely loves it 100%. We only had one issue,  trying to figure out how to get to the main screen, but once we found the process on Amazon.com,  it was easy."
"3872","Great!!! Works perfectly. ..."
"3873","Very good deal for the money."
"3874","Good product, the ads when you open it up are annoying though, if it advertised the types books I actually read, it would be ok. But sadly, it has no clue. If it wasn't for this, five stars."
"3875","I LOVE IT. It's perfect. I haven't had a new kindle since the first one. What a difference! I really like the fact that the battery lasts so much longer. My old one only lasted about 4 days."
"3876","This product is great, it's totally technology. We have moved so fast, that even book are not an exception. I enjoy reading in my kindle more than any book, it makes me feel great, powerful."
"3877","It is anti glare which is great and it is easy to use! I do have trouble connecting to wifi sometimes. Other than that it works great. I love using this at the pool especially while tanning."
"3878","Altho' I was looking forward to this Kindle, it was disappointing, the screen was not clear making it difficult for me to read, I returned it!"
"3879","Very happy to get this is #3!"
"3880","It is was easy to set up . I love that you just touch the screen to get to the next page. The price was really good too. If you love to read this is the kindle for you should take a look at."
"3881","I am so happy I am able to buy many books and put that one copy on my 12 devices. I use my kindles in my classroom and this makes owning a class set of books a lot cheaper. Thank you Amazon!"
"3882","For the price, not bad at all!"
"3883","Was very good! What I expected"
"3884","I surprisingly really like it!"
"3885","Instructions could be clearer."
"3886","Great productGreat price"
"3887","Lightweight and user friendly!"
"3888","Can't wait to read in the sun!"
"3889","Excelent Kindle For the price."
"3890","I wish I would have gotten this years ago.  Much better than ipad for reading. Totally instincive to use. No instructions necessary. Good selection of free books. Good feel and battery life."
"3891","Avoids distractions. Love the availability of dictionaries and how easy it's to consult things.The only thing that I think this product misses is something to regulate light intensity."
"3892","Over all great product. Easy to ready. Page turn seems a bit laggy. Product is light but feels almost cheaply made for the amount you pay for it. My older keyboard kindle felt much sturdier."
"3893","At $49 it was a steal. It works great. Delivery was right on time. Is what the Dr. ordered, she recommended going to one that was not backlit. So price dropped at a great time. Thanks again!"
"3894","I love my kindle! The battery lasts for so long on very little charge and with prime membership I havent paid for one book yet. I like that it is lightweight and easy to tote along with me."
"3895","This kindle is great! Can be at the beach full of sun and able to read with no issues. Light weight and great for travel. Instead of carrying many reading materials all I need is the Kindle"
"3896","Very nice item. A little smaller than I was expecting, but considering that my first generation Kindle was larger and had the keyboard, it's all good. Very quick and easy sync with my WiFi."
"3897","Only complaint is that it's a bit heavier than the old kindle touch, which i unfortunately left on an airplane, but the screen is much easier to read with brighter contrast and more detail."
"3898","This kindle is pretty good so far. I am able to recover my books. It's small and convenient. It does freezes which is irritating especially if you are reading a good book. It's okay so far."
"3899","Great product at a fair price."
"3900","Love the size and touch screen"
"3901","Great and super fast shipping!"
"3902","Lightweight, easy, great gift."
"3903","I waited many years before I broke down and finally bought a kindle. My husband immediately started using it so I haven""t had a chance to try it. I think I see another one in my future!"
"3904","The touchscreen took a little getting used to, but now that I have gotten used to it I love it much more than the original Kindle. It is much easier to navigate and it responds much faster."
"3905","So much nicer than my kindle from a year and a half ago! Love the touch screen feature. Next time I will upgrade to back light feature, but this Kindle works well with my lighted case cover"
"3906","Bought this for my husband for Christmas, he isn't a computer type of guy but loves to read and he can see without glasses to read after I adjusted the print. Very happy with this item also"
"3907","Love it!  Period! Wished it had active calendar, address book and calculator ""apps"" available.  Love X-ray, dictionaries, touch keyboard.  Will give as presents to kids & grandkids."
"3908","It was a gift but they love it"
"3909","Easy to use.  Light in weight."
"3910","very please.  was as promised."
"3911","Absolutely love my new Kindle touch ereader.  Eveything is so easy to navigate, its small, light weight and fits into my pocket book so easily. shipping was prompt, so that was a plus too."
"3912","I'm glad I bought this Kindle."
"3913","Definitely meets expectations!"
"3914","I love the glare free screen!!"
"3915","Got it for 50$, very good deal"
"3916","I guess I did not read it well enough on the functions, or I haven't  figured out how to turn brightness on, anyway it's a light weight easy to use,just need a lamp to read under at night."
"3917","I got the item and it is great"
"3918","The touch screen is so sensitive a fly or a flying leaf or a wisp of hair changes the page. And it moves me sometimes a chapter ahead and I take ages to figure out where in the book I was."
"3919","It's pretty good. I reads good"
"3920","The touch screen is way too sensitive. When you tap to turn a page it jumps backward and seems to have a mind of its own. I lose my place all the time and can't get back. Very frustrating."
"3921","it is perfect thank you amazon"
"3922","works well and is easy to use."
"3923","After a while, seeing freezes."
"3924","Not ""Glare-free"""
"3925","I want this for my kids."
"3926","So far can't be beat, love it."
"3927","Great for being out in the sun"
"3928","Great in bright light!!!"
"3929","Good! Hope it was stretchable!"
"3930","It's good and excellent."
"3931","Great size, shape, and weight!"
"3932","Great buy for the money!"
"3933","Battery won't last long if you keep Wi-Fi on all the time (about four days). The screen is pretty good, however, if you wonna read comic books, you had better choose the KPW (higher ppi)."
"3934","Very clear screen, nice software, but it could improve a little, perfect for reading with a paper-like experience. I just didn't like the material it's made of, it's very easy to scratch."
"3935","It works real good just love it"
"3936","Everything I expected and more."
"3937","Perfect affordable and reliable"
"3938","It works good for me. Thank you"
"3939","Perfect. Exactly what I wanted."
"3940","I love stuff that works; Amazon, UPS, Packages that will open, and Products that are precharged and work straight out of the package !!!"
"3941","I love the fact that I can read outside and have no glare, small and compact, easy to carry. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that at times it is a little glitchy and it freezes."
"3942","I read all the time, it's great"
"3943","Excellent item. Would recommend"
"3944","Very nice, wish it was backlit."
"3945","for just reading a book perfect"
"3946","I am so addicted to this thing!"
"3947","It's a great deal for what it does. I wish I would have purchased the white, so I wouldn't have to strain my eyes. With a book light I'm good. It's a great little buy for this book worm."
"3948","I like it better than the one I had before (the original Kindle), but I only bought it because the screen went bad on my other one and I didn't want to lose all of the books I had on it."
"3949","I upgraded my Kindle Keyboard  to the KindleTouch and I love it!  The print seems even clearer than before (it might be my imagination).  It's great and for the price you can't beat it."
"3950","excellent quality, easy to use."
"3951","Love It!!!!!!! 5stars!!!!!!!!!!"
"3952","was as describe happy with item"
"3953","Girlfriend loves it - no issues"
"3954","love it. especially dictionary."
"3955","Perfect. Everything I have come to expect and more. I love the simple interface and user friendliness. Easy to update and buy books from the kindle store. Light and comfortable to hold."
"3956","Yes, I just love the new kindle"
"3957","Very good for the price you pay"
"3958","My little besty in my purse lol"
"3959","Perfect, exactly how described!"
"3960","It's my constant companion at the park, at the lake fishing & doctor's offices and I'm sure, THE DMV!And every night for relaxation. No more TV, Thank God! No more commercials!!!"
"3961","Yes so cool it is so easy to use u just swipe 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️If I could I would give it ten stars⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"3962","Had slight scuffs and scratches"
"3963","Excellent and got a great orice"
"3964","A great device for reading.  My wife was using an iPad for reading Kindle books and found it too large and cumbersome.  She likes the samller size and so far the battery life is great."
"3965","Easy to use, fast response, everything you need in an e-reader. Also ordered custom-designed cover,which is extremely well designed, and almost a necessity for security and protection."
"3966","This works perfect at the beach. There is no light on it so you can not read in the dark but I didn't need that. Nice small and light. Fits perfect in your purse. Love the touch screen"
"3967","I haven't fully learned all about my kindle yet. For simply reading it seems fine. I think it will be much simpler once I have used it a while. I was disappointed to find Amazon selling it for $20 less now than on Black Friday."
"3968","Love the Kindle, Amazon's cover price is really ridiculous when other suppliers offer a nicer case for a better price - waiting to get my case/cover"
"3969","Everything I hoped it would be."
"3970","Very user friendly.  I like it."
"3971","I really don't like the touchscreen much, but I am not use to it so maybe I will like soon. I like to turn pages with a button though, so we'll see. I do love my Kindle no more paper."
"3972","I wish I had bought the backlit version, but this works perfectly. I chose this option because it's cheaper. The weight is nice, the screen is clear, and the interface is easy to use."
"3973","I didn't realize that ""glare-free"" meant it had no light. Maybe it will make me happier to read digitally than my ipad or itouch did, but it will take awhile to discover that."
"3974","The screen is so dark I couldn t read it. Indoors or out, it was hopeless. There did not seem to be any way to adjust it for a brighter screen. It remained a dark grey ground with blurry grey print. And it wasn t ''me''--I showed a young friend and he couldn t see it either. It also arrived late. I returned this Kindle and I ll order a Paperwhite instead."
"3975","The cost of postage on certain paper books makes them a non option for someone who takes care of his economy, so for someone who reads a LOT and doesn't want to use up the precious space with yet more books, this is an investment.User friendly.Page looks as close as dammit to paper.Light.There are so many free (ahem) not quite legal downloads of books available that one can probably buy one of these and forget paying for books or visiting a library for a few years :)"
"3976","I love the Kindle 6"" Glare-Free, it's like using my IPhone so easy plus it's light weight and fits in a small purse, great for travel. This is my 4th Kindle, they just get better!"
"3977","I have the original Kindle and I finally dropped it too many times. This new basic version is so much better in size, readability, and ease of use that  I am thrilled that I upgraded."
"3978","This is a very economically priced device that is quite readable.  I am using it as a back-up to my Kindle Fire, and it works as the more limited reader that I was hoping it would be."
"3979","Being 25 years old, I completed my first ever story book (The Paper Towns) on this Kindle. I'm not even kidding, I can't stand reading story book. For me personally, science books are all I read.10/10 Would read another teenager adventure story book again."
"3980","It's really like paper! awesome!"
"3981","What were the special offers?..."
"3982","Excellent quality and very handy"
"3983","I love it! It's light and handy!"
"3984","Shipped quick.  Arrived in tact."
"3985","Yes very happy with new kindle 6"
"3986","I love this! I have tried to read outside on my iPad for years. I spent the weekend on the beach and the clarity is unbelievably, clear. It's light, so you can hold it with one hand."
"3987","Awesome upgrade from my old Kindle.  Easy to use and a lot easier to carry around due to it's small size.The ads don't bother me and I like having books recommended to me"
"3988","The Kindle 6"" feels very much like a small paperback book, reads much like a paperback book. It was easy to learn how to use it. The hard part is determining which books to read."
"3989","i hate the touch screen to turn the page, way to often it skips forward 2, 3, 4, pages because a finger gets near the screen, other than that i love my kindle, can't live without it."
"3990","It didn't come when it was supposed to but it seems to work fine. Pretty neat that I don't have to pack around heavy books I cash just carry my kindle and read which books I want to."
"3991","amazing! better than i expected!"
"3992","Everything has been good so far."
"3993","This device is awesome....period"
"3994","This Kindle is great. The touch technology for page turning is easy to use and fast. I wanted a device that does not emit the blue light and this Kindle does not have the blue light."
"3995","A blessing to my son who has a eye problem but also gives lessons before people can video then take home to see were he needs improvementjust needs inf. On video storage better"
"3996","I love this kindle it is great to just grab and go, let the kids read, and the battery last forever! I've owned 4 different gens of kindles and this is my second fav to my paperwhite"
"3997","I love my little compact Kindle. I can take it with me anywhere I go by putting it in my purse. I love how I can read it even in the sunlight. Great gift I received for Christmas! :)"
"3998","Got this to take on vacation and read on the beach. Worked flawlessly and I actually liked the screen so much I use it all the time."
"3999","I bought my first kindle touch like two weeks before thanksgiving. It was for $79. But the price slipped to $49 on thanksgiving. I am feeling upset. However , that did not stop me from buying two more kindles@$49. Sure its a great device but I am moaning about my $30 that I could have saved."
"4000","Love it.  This thing is great and allows me to finally read outside and by the pool  I love being able to take my whole collection with me.It travels with me everywhere!"
"4001","Very happy exactly as described."
"4002","very nice, met all expectations."
"4003","simple and light.  Great product"
"4004","Delivers most of the previous functions that my prior generation paperwhite except the screen is not back lit.  I should've bought the model with that function on the pricier model."
"4005","I love my new Kindle. I have one of the older models with the forward an back buttons and I have enjoyed it for years. This new one is smaller and t e touch screen is so easy to use"
"4006","Excellent gadget to carry around all of your book and ease of convenience. The only grouse that I have abot this product is that it heavier than I would have liked .... just saying!"
"4007","Great improvement over my old Kindle.  Faster & non-glare screen.  The only complaint is it changes the font size when I am reading.  It takes a few minutes to change it back again."
"4008","Kindle is just fine.  Just fine."
"4009","this is great for an avid reader"
"4010","I enjoy this Kindle very much!!!"
"4011","Screen blinks, difficult to read"
"4012","Awesome product for the price! Love the paper like screen. It's like reading a paper book ! Perfect for the beach or everyday reading. This got me excited about reading again. A++ !"
"4013","I have issues with my eyesight and this kindle has been a life saver for me! I can enjoy reading without the glare and I don't get a head ache from reading on my kindle. Very happy!"
"4014","Really nice, actually. Little bit of lag between finger swipe or inputing my passcode. I can put in my whole code and hit enter before it registers, sometimes. Otherwise, I approve."
"4015","I've gotten used to reading on the kindle app on my iPad mini, so I'm getting used to the smaller screen. There are some functions I wish the Kindle touch had, but I like it so far."
"4016","Good for basic reading."
"4017","Nice product. Worth it."
"4018","Works great! Just what we needed"
"4019","Item was like new, as described."
"4020","This is the first time I have used a kindle. I am pleased with it's performance but was disappointed the it could not be read in the dark. Other than that it is very user friendly."
"4021","I was disappointed, it froze at times. very annoying. I am a house bound WWII 86 year old vet and I do miss my kindle. Hope the new one I order will be as dependable as my old one."
"4022","I wish the reading page was lighter, and I get frustrated having to open the reading screen if I leave it for five minutes.These are my two major concerns, everything else is fine."
"4023","Easy to use. Print size is good."
"4024","As described and works perfectly"
"4025","Just as good as Amazon promises."
"4026","after using a ladies kindle from my churchI just had to have one of my ownmy husband surprised me with one and I love itthanks honey I love you and love my kindle"
"4027","I thought I wanted an ebook reader that wasn't as heavy or backlit, but in the end it turns out that I like my Kindle Fire better."
"4028","The kindle 6"" size is much nicer than the original kindle.The non glare screen works well even outside. I really like the touch screen very sensitive. No more keyboard in the way."
"4029","Great product at a great price! I love how this embodies all the qualities I enjoyed from the kindle touch with just a smaller size and a lighter weight. Definitely worth the buy!"
"4030","Very nice screen. I wish it was a little brighter or a way to change the brightness levels but it's very easy to use and navigate if you don't like looking at instructions like me"
"4031","Great product. It serves my purpose for simply reading books electronically. No bells and whistles, but that wasn't what I was looking for and wouldn't expect at this price point."
"4032","It works great for what I need.  Small, lightweight.  Use it to read to some residents in a nursing home.  Fits easily into my purse and can download short stories or long novels."
"4033","Hard to reach the home page or the top portion of the Kindle. When I try to access that I end up turning the pages.  Ugh!!Slim and easy to carry around."
"4034","I thought the book presented an adequate analysis of Buchanan' s life. At times, the author spent too much time on minor political matters. There should have been a more thorough discussion of his personal life. I would rate the book a 7 out of 10"
"4035","Great Kindle, especially like the touch and x-ray. Its light, can carry it in your pocket, and read any where. Plus, only a takes a few seconds to download a book from the cloud."
"4036","Love my Kindle!  I have a Fire and bought this to supplement for outside reading over the summer.  I absolutely adore it!!  Works great in sunshine.  Easy to hold.  Just perfect!"
"4037","The Kindle 6"" anti-glare display was exactly what i was looking for.Great product,might opt to get an upgraded version next with backlight.Was everything that was advertised."
"4038","Great for casual reading which is all I wanted it for.Also easy to get new books through PRIME.  Anything else I need to do I can do from my tablet (sharing with family library)."
"4039","My mother can read again. She loves. Just wish I could enlarge the main screen for her too so she could read that herself and click on the book she wants to read without my help."
"4040","Great kindle, works great so far."
"4041","It good and it's very easy to use"
"4042","I have enjoyed the Kindle so much"
"4043","I love the kindle itself my biggest disappointment is that there are no contacts on this one to use with a lighted cover. I hate having to keep track of a separate reading light."
"4044","Big love!.. Wanted a reader that would allow me to actually unplug and read! No app-distractions to muddle with my quiet time. Thank you for keeping this simple option available!"
"4045","Exactly what was expected.  My original Kindle died (battery would not charge) and this new device fits the bill.  Definitely recommend for a good, basic reader without a light."
"4046","I love this smaller kindle. .I was unable to read my Kindle fire in the sunlight,  so I got this one. No problems seeing it outside. Also, it's easy to handle since it's smaller"
"4047","Easy to carry, reading and one-time charging is good for several days. This is something I wanted since a long time. Moreover got $30 off on my purchase during Thanksgiving day."
"4048","just what i expected. no problem."
"4049","I love it.  It gets the job done!"
"4050","The only disappointment is the fact that it doesn't light up.  That was something I was looking forward to.Thanks,Cathy Traversctravers@bostonprivate.com"
"4051","I wish I had spent $40 more for the paperwhite version so I would read at night easier.  Otherwise, this version is very enjoyable and has lightening speed.  Overall, I like it."
"4052","Great for reading in the bright sun.  I still use my Kindle Fire indoors, but use the glare-free at the pool and beach.  I also like how light weight it is compared to the Fire."
"4053","My Kindle is perfect!  I love the non-glare screen and the lack of back-lighting as the light bothers my eyes.  It is light weight and easy to carry anywhere.  Thank you Amazon!"
"4054","Very convenient and easy to use.  Good price point.  Would like it to be a little more adjustable, e.g., brightness (although not critical).  It is very light and user-friendly."
"4055","It's lightweight and easy to use."
"4056","why didn't I get this sooner !!!!"
"4057","Quick download speed, easy to use"
"4058","Absolutely love my new Kindle!!!!"
"4059","Perfect for what I wanted it for."
"4060","It is a very good reading device."
"4061","Just the right size to Cary about"
"4062","Light and easy to use we love it."
"4063","We bought both the Kindle Touch (for hubby) and Kindle Paperwhite (for me) as they had different functions - I read at night & really appreciate the front lit Kindle Paperwhite."
"4064","absolutely no instructions on hoe to operate and when a person that is technically challenged as I am I need lots of instructions.  Am seriously thinking of returning it to you."
"4065","The icon to adjust the lighting level is non-existent.  Guess I need to call Amazon and see if there is something they can do -- or replace it with a different device.  Other than that, it's just like the original Kindle that my dog ate!"
"4066","Christmas present for my Mom, she loves it.  I have the original Kindle and I must say I'm a little jealous.  Easy set up, great picture, love the long battery life.  Excellent"
"4067","Excellent for reading in the sun."
"4068","I like being able to read outside"
"4069","Arrived in record time.  Love it."
"4070","I am very happy with my purchase."
"4071","Exactly what I wanted! Simple to use and looks as realistic as a tablet could get to a book! The pages are crisp and glare free. Definitely lightweight and easy to travel with."
"4072","I'm giving this to a friend so I don't know to much about it.  I gave it 5 stars because it looks like it will work good for my friend.  My husband has one & he really look it."
"4073","Now reading ""FREE"" (excluding purchase price) by downloading from the public library (at home) my favorite authors.  The size and weight of the Kindle are just right..."
"4074","Great transaction, great product!"
"4075","Great improvements.  I've had a Kindle for 4 years and love it, but the improvements made have made the experience so much better.  I like the smaller size and on screen touch."
"4076","The Kindle is just as I expected."
"4077","Greater than I expected to be...."
"4078","Took awhile to enter WiFi but once done it works quite well. Between my desktop, smartphone & Kindle I may never again use hardcopy. I actually got the Paperwhite  for my wife."
"4079","Everything is great BUT it has no option to increase the brightness to this device. If the lighting isn't bright outside or in, you can't see it. :(  Please fix!"
"4080","Great job Kindle..Nice machine 😃"
"4081","The product feels great in hand, and user experience is fantastic! I can also feel that much durability and reliability is built in. Best kindle I ever had! Strongly recommend!"
"4082","I can't wait to get books on it!!"
"4083","A little bundle of Joy. Love this little devise. I have a great time reading it. The only thing is that it does not have a back light. However it is great and I like it a lot."
"4084","AWESOME!! Battery lasts FOREVER!!"
"4085","Got the Paperwhite 300DPI As gift for Christmas and this one as well. Very happy with it. Built in light big advantage so kept that one but this would more than meet my needs."
"4086","The touch screen reliability is wildly uneven. The device takes too long to power off because won't recognize the box for ""power off""I regret making the purchase"
"4087","Performance is as advertised. This size is easy to hold and although I've always enjoyed holding a book,the device is very handy and you can easily adjust the font size."
"4088","Buy this for the book lover in your life, not only will they save tons of money on books every year but they will also produce less book clutter in your house. It's a win win."
"4089","Fast delivery and love the product"
"4090","The size is perfict for commuting."
"4091","Works as expected for an entry level e-reader. If you want more features you need to move to a higher Kindle model. Otherwise, this is light, comfortable and easy on the eyes."
"4092","I love my new Kindle my son got me for Christmas!  Getting books is easy and I can change the font size so that I can actually see what I'm reading.  It really is glare free!"
"4093","Light-weight, easy to read, I still love paper books, but as e-readers go, this is SO much better than reading the glare of a cell-phone or my tablet.  Glad I invested in it."
"4094","Easy to read and compact to carry."
"4095","received as a gift,love it so far."
"4096","Easy to use, long lasting battery!"
"4097","Wonderful and an excellent buy! (:"
"4098","My daughter loves her new kindle!!"
"4099","My son loves it for reading books."
"4100","Was a little worried about the screen being too small...but the easy touch turning of the pages made it easy to fly along.  After you get used to it, it's a breeze.  Love it."
"4101","Fantastic! I have had a kindle for years but the new touch screen makes everything so much easier. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves kindle and loves to read."
"4102","I have 3 other Kindles and this one actually seems sort of clunky compared to the others although this one supposedly is touch and swipe. Some functions are hidden and it wasn't easy to find out how to perform certain functions. Getting the toolbar seems erratic, sometimes it appears while tapping at the top other times, I'm just tapping and nothing. I also do not like the little advertising banner at the bottom for books at the bottom when at rest. Additionally my cloud list of books is headed by 3 entries of a Russian-English Dictionary that I didn't buy, don't want, and can't get rid of (ABBYYLingvo...). Very frustrating. I'll pick my own languages.I considered just sending the device back - still considering. Not your best effort .PS: Is the latest Kindle User's Guide the 4th?? Didn't seem to apply to my device - is there another?Screen savers: I much preferred the images of great authors as opposed to ""50 great Read for $2 each"""
"4103","It is very good! I really like it."
"4104","So fun I am enjoying it immensely!"
"4105","I don't care for it. It is not as good as my old one and I can't transfer all my items to this new one. I'm sorry I bought it"
"4106","Love it! It was already linked to my amazon account, so my cloud books were right there. I've had mine three weeks and it is still on the first charge. I read some everyday."
"4107","I use this all the time. It's my go-to now for reading on the plane, replacing my i-Pad mini, which was heavier. And this way, I don't have to pack 3 physical books with me."
"4108","Very happy with this purchase. I would recommend kindle to anyone looking for a simple e-reader that is only that. I bought this because it had gotten so many great reviews."
"4109","This is my 3rd kindle I keep in my purse so I always have my library with me.  Great little device.  Lightweight, clear print, and effortless to operate.  Loving my kindles."
"4110","start using it right away, love it"
"4111","Loving my Kindle. I wasn't looking for anything fancy and this fits the bill. Pages are clear and easy to read and there are lots of other functions for those who need them."
"4112","My son really likes his new Kindle"
"4113","Muchuch better than older versions"
"4114","I am satisfied with my Kindle 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen reader.  I will use it when I travel and leave my Kindle Fire at home.  It will be excellent for a second Kindle."
"4115","Love my kindle. Very happy with it"
"4116","Great, I love it.  Screen is different from my old one and I get a little confused but have only been using it for 3 days and am sure I will like it better than the old one."
"4117","Good for kids and their parents :)"
"4118","Wished I had back lite"
"4119","I purchased this for my mom and she loves it! Screen size is just right, the way the page turns and of coarse the ease of getting books off of amazon. Would purchase again."
"4120","Too dark. Could not read the page."
"4121","Love it! So light and easy to use!"
"4122","Great device.  Read on it nightly."
"4123","Great product. Needs backlighting."
"4124","Performs as expected.  Nothing flashy and a good price point.  Want more features?  Get a more expensive model.  The built in ads at the home screen don't bother me at all."
"4125","Just what I wanted/Expected. I wasn't looking for all the bells and whistles and this is exactly it. Only four stars because I didn't know about it not having a back light."
"4126","easy to read.  love the paper white lighting - can read anywhere.  also like that the font size can be increased or decreased easily and that I can get new books so easily."
"4127","Maybe I was expecting too much but I found it difficult to read.  It was too dark.  I should have just kept using my original Kindle which I wish I still had (it was lost)."
"4128","first time using an ereader, I was rather hesitant as i like books, but after using this - i am sold that this is the future. Not planning on buying anymore physical books."
"4129","This little thingy is awesome because it has all the books you could ever want packed into one thing. It's like a baby except it isn't annoying and doesn't poop everywhere."
"4130","Love it.  Even better than I imagined.  I love how everything you buy goes to the cloud as well as your device and then you can download it to all your devices if you want."
"4131","Love my new Kindle! It is exactly what I needed and I've only had it for one day and I'm already reading much more than I used to because it makes the experience so simple."
"4132","Fast shipping and reasonable deal😊"
"4133","Great for both indoors and outdoors"
"4134","This was a present from my daughter and family for Mother's Day. Love it. Now if it had the same features with added back light for night reading it would be perfect."
"4135","Relatively light. Easy to read under most lighting conditions. Only negative is the angled, smooth back making it hard to prop up in a good position for hands-free reading."
"4136","good"
"4137","I hate it! Amazon is so consumed with spamming you with their ""suggestions"" that you cant even get to (and read) the book you'd like to read?! What the heck is it with these ""3 free videos""? No decent/easy way to get around this constant barrage of promotions and data mining of your account - they've gone overboard and the backlash is mounting - I think they killed the golden goose this time.... Cant they just sell you a product and be satisfied with that? (Greed!)cheers"
"4138","I had an old keyboard kindle that I inherited from my dad. I mostly liked it and for straight book reading it was fine. But trying to go back and forth between books, or even inside books (like a bible) was a nightmare. I thought this touch kindle would be better. And it is easier to navigate inside the bible, that's certain. And with some credits and a gift card I only paid $25 for it. So I guess I shouldn't complain. But I had Every Word on my old kindle and I liked playing it for a few minutes at night before I went to bed. No Word Games on This Kindle. And if I'm wrong about this, please tell me, because I'd like some!!!! But on all the games -- even the ones you have to buy -- this 7th generation kindle is never listed as an available device. Sigh... Plus I liked the old screen savers better than advertising for books that I don't necessarily want. You get what you pay for."
"4139","Very valuable accessory. Eliminates the need to carry around the additional bulk of books, and allows to borrow books from the library. The screen is very clear and crisp."
"4140","Got this for my 83 year old boss. She LOVES it.Easy to use, easy to see, can make letter big or small.Nice weight, she reads this all day long.Great gift"
"4141","Wonderful device that keeps running without a charge for a long period of time.  Easy to use, easy to access new books, and helps reduce the book clutter around the house."
"4142","One thing I miss is being able to rotate the screen other wise I found it much more convenient with the touch screen rather then buttons every thing else is about the same"
"4143","For $79 you can't be it. It is a great reading experience, simple, and the battery lasts a long time. I also have an iPad mini but like the kindle much better for reading."
"4144","Quick delivery.  Order as expected."
"4145","My girls love it! I wish I had one!"
"4146","Reads just like a book only better."
"4147","It's very light! So far, I love it."
"4148","Disappointed that active content went away.  My wife liked to play games on the one she dropped; this was intended as a replacement.  It fell far short of my expectations."
"4149","Love it, I went from a first edition Kindle to the 6"" glare-free with a case. The ""6"" is light-weight and the case allows it to stand up allowing for easy use."
"4150","My wife wanted just an ereader so I bought this one for her birthday.  She enjoys it.  Easy to read and she just wants to read.  No web browsing. No games.  Fits the bill."
"4151","The Kindle is everything I had hoped for and more. It has a bright easy to read screen and variable font sizes.Do not know what else they could put in there for the money."
"4152","I expected to be able to switch to a different language with the push of a tab. The information on the product report it indicated you can compare many different language."
"4153","great product, great delivery time."
"4154","Works very nice.  Enjoying it alot."
"4155","Just got this. Liking it very well."
"4156","This thing is awesome. Enough said."
"4157","bought it to read & it reads great!"
"4158","The touchscreen feels a little weird but definitely check out the landscape mode. So awesome. Touch targets are a little tight, but only because I have large fingers haha."
"4159","The Kindle was perfect, but I reallized that I wanted to play a few word games and this model doesn't support games.  It would be great for classroom use or for textbooks."
"4160","Great first Kindle for my ""non-techie"" husband.  He loves it, and stayed up almost all night reading for the first time ever! Cudos to this special, small Kindle!"
"4161","So far so good, a gift for my wife."
"4162","Love it..easy to use,hold and see.."
"4163","It is so portable and a great deal."
"4164","Almost a paper book like experience"
"4165","This was a birthday gift to our son.  He downloads his college books to it and really likes the fact that it is backlit and he can read in the dark at night while in bed."
"4166","I love my kindle, it would be prefect if it was back lit or came with an affordable case.  Reading at night is challenging, but easier than with a traditional paper book."
"4167","Great improvements have been made to this device. I absolutely recommend it to all book worms around the globe. Touch screen feature has truly made it more user friendly."
"4168","Just the right size works perfectly"
"4169","Received  it and as I am not real tech savvy, it took me awhile to set it up with our Wi-Fi and had to start over several times.  But now it is functioning and I love it."
"4170","I purchased this primarily to be able to read my own PDF files without having to print them out.  I'm also pleased with the e-ink display, which is very easy on the eyes."
"4171","bought this as a gift for my mom.  (75 yo)  she loves it.  Very light, easy to use.  She is an avid reader and this has changed her mind on using tablets to read.  Thanks"
"4172","this is the first kindle i have ever had and i love it. i love the access to free ebooks that i could not afford to buy.  this is the best buy i have made in a long time."
"4173","Great product. Coild only be faster"
"4174","I got it as a gift and it is great."
"4175","Love it! So light and easy to hold."
"4176","Convince, easy to pack in my purse."
"4177","Excellent!! This is our 4th Kindle!"
"4178","I've had very good use of this Kindle, it has been in service for several months at this point and I can't tell that it's not new. It does everything I expected from it."
"4179","It has worked very well.  I still have a learning curve as my old Kindle did work differently but I'm enjoying it so far.  The touch screen is definitely an improvement."
"4180","My first Kindle. Really good value."
"4181","Didn't expect more. Simply awesome."
"4182","I am very pleased with my purchase."
"4183","It's okay battery life is fantastic"
"4184","Its ok. Need more processing power."
"4185","i love it!!! i love reading anyway but this just opened up a whole new world. Now i can read a book and not have to worry about finding a place to put it when I am done."
"4186","Does this Kindle model have ""audible"" capacity?  I thought I was getting one that had speakers and the ability to ""listen"" for a friend who no longer can read"
"4187","I wasn't happy with the size and it isn't very user friendly. I prefer to read using the app on my iPhone. I don't see the advantage of using this over an iPhone 6plus."
"4188","The light is really important I guess. Overall I'm satisfied with the amount paid for this Kindle $59.I hope Amazon will put audio port in the future and make it colorful."
"4189","I love kindles. I really do. But I can't bring myself to purchase any more. I've had three in the span of 5 years, and all three have frozen on me for no reason, leaving me to be forced to buy another one. The point of a kindle is to house all your books, If I'm constantly having to repurchase, I may as well just go back to buying paperbacks."
"4190","I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN IT..I HAVE TROUBLE LEARNING HOW TO DELETE STUFF OFF OF IT...WISHED IT CAME WITH A BOOK OF DIRECTIONS, BELIEVE I LIKED THE OTHER MODEL BETTER."
"4191","I received this as a Christmas gift, and after having used it for a month, I'm still on the fence as to its worth. It is easy to read and mostly glare free. However, the touchscreen is SUPER sensitive and it seems like it is always opening up different windows when I pick it up or hold it with one hand (not on the screen, mind you, but on the edges). Also, the ads are annoying. I don't understand why I would buy a device on which I have to constantly look at ads."
"4192","Perfect anniversary  gift for my hunting and fishing hubby. he was surprised and excited, It works well inside and outside. light weight to carry and long battery life."
"4193","This is the best investment I have made.  I make the time to read. The font and page size are perfect.  It is so easy to look up words. Wish I had done this year's ago!"
"4194","Love it!  Couldn't me happier with this Kindle reader with touchscreen display.  My 1st Kindle reader was a 1st edition and I loved it too, but this one is even better."
"4195","Nice smallish size.  Easy to get started without having to read instructions much.  Screen seems a little dark.  Sometimes need to have lamp on in order to see to read."
"4196","Kids like reading books with kindle."
"4197","Wonderful!  Exceeded my expectation!"
"4198","Great Product!! Amazing Technology!!"
"4199","I thought it was great until I found it at Staples on Sale $30.00 cheaper. Other than overpaying for it, I read more than ever before and enjoy doing it with my Kindle."
"4200","It works well in lighted environment"
"4201","Would have rather had the old style."
"4202","Love it still trying to figure it oo"
"4203","kindle is as i promises, great to read on, small, lightwieght and the battery lasts forever. organizing reading material however is clunky and very difficult. que sera"
"4204","Great product. Makes me want to read"
"4205","I'm enjoying this tablet.  Love to sit out on the patio now that the weather is cooling off a bit, and read.  I couldn't do it with my Kindle Fire.Thanks Amazon,"
"4206","I really like this Kindle reader, I also have the lighted version and both are super readers.  I like the touch screen that is very fast and can be done with one hand."
"4207","Nice if you don't like read at night"
"4208","I have really enjoyed my new Kindle and the ease that goes into using it.It was rrady for me to use out of the box.All I had to do was sync my account and FB together."
"4209","Love the Kindle.  It is easy to hold and holds a lot.  Only disappointment is that it doesn't seem to hold a charge as long as the paperwork said but it is a few days."
"4210","Exceeded my expectations...I love it"
"4211","Much easier to use and handle than the keyboard Kindle.  I encourage you to buy the Amazon folder that puts the Kindle to sleep automatically when you close the cover."
"4212","Glare free really makes a difference"
"4213","I like it reading and finding a word I don't know and not haveing to look it up in a dictionary. I don't like the fact that there is no light behind the screen though."
"4214","I needed an e-reader that I could use in the sunlight. This is perfect. The Glare-Free feature is everything it's advertised to be. I recommend it without reservation."
"4215","Fine to read, but difficult to hold without touching the screen and then having unwanted changes made.  Frequently reverts back to tiny print and difficult to make it change back to the desired font.  May be better if it is in a case."
"4216","Love this Kindle. I have Fire, and really like it, but to read in the sun on it is impossible. With this, I can read in bright sunlight with no problem. Very pleased."
"4217","Purchased for my wife. She loves it."
"4218","Fast shipment; product as described!"
"4219","Quick service. My daughter loves it."
"4220","It's nice and light and I love that you can read it even if the sun is really bright. One this that I wish they would have added was a back light for easing at night."
"4221","Great product to replace my wife's nook that died tragically. Screen seems a bit smaller but she is very happy with it and says she likes it better than her old nook."
"4222","I have trouble seeing on it. This is my third kindle . My old one was my favorite. . And I had to replace it with this one. I would trade it for an old one if I could"
"4223","I like the newer format and features"
"4224","Bought for my wife and she loves it."
"4225","just as expected. very light in weight. easy to lay around and read comfortably without the weight of a heavy hard cover book. i like the kindle user lending library."
"4226","Awesome for the price"
"4227","Well worth the money!"
"4228","can't do with out it."
"4229","I love it.  No glare & easy to read."
"4230","Good product met my need very nicely"
"4231","I definitely recommend this product."
"4232","By far one of my greatest purchases."
"4233","Loved this!  Great Birthday present!"
"4234","One word....fantastic"
"4235","Never had a paperwhite...just an original kindle fire. Wanting something that I could take to the beach and something that wouldn't cause eye strain. So far so good."
"4236","Very nice product!! My client loved!!"
"4237","I love my new Kindle!  I travel regularly and always lug books around with me for professional and pleasure reading.  My Kindle fits in my small crossbody bag purse!"
"4238","Great device for reading. Works great"
"4239","Perfect  timing  and love the product"
"4240","Nothing wrong with the item but disappointed because the day after I ordered it and before it was delivered the price dropped by $20. I would liked to have had the lower price."
"4241","It is just more then I had expected."
"4242","It does everything I needed. If you are going to buy it make sure you do not want the screen to be lit from behind. You will need an external light to read this one."
"4243","Kindle arrived on time and did everything I expected it to. I really appreciate how easy it is to read in the sun, the screen does an excellent job being glare free."
"4244","This model is too wide and slippery to hold in one hand comfortably in one hand. I have large hands I returned this and ordered the better model and I am very happy."
"4245","It was the perfect gift for Christmas"
"4246","Husband's first kindle.  He loves it!"
"4247","Fantastic!! Best money I ever spent!!"
"4248","I think it is great and it really beats carrying a heavy book around. I have enjoyed it very much since I got it and buying the books beats going to a store to shop."
"4249","Gave it as a gift at Christmas. Is just a reader, not an HD video tablet. Perfect for a young adult and with Amazon Prime it makes it easy to give the gift of books."
"4250","Love it!  It's small enough to fit in my purse easily and it goes everywhere with me.  You never know when you have to stand in a long line and can read a few pages."
"4251","Works great with no glare in sunny conditions. Very lightweight and easier than holding a book. Would be an added bonus if it came with a light for reading at night."
"4252","It's not exactly  what I thought it was. But that was my fault for not reading the description  better. It definitely  serves it's purpose  though. I'm happy with it"
"4253","Is perfect fit for take along reading"
"4254","Perfect for me, except no back light."
"4255","Its better to read off of than a Ipad"
"4256","The price on the special offer was excellent, but I really miss the lighting of the Paperwhite. Other than that, my new Kindle is fun and good to read on the beach."
"4257","My boyfriend loves it!!!If you want to read other language book, you can find the way.He reads e-book with English, Korea, Japanese, Chinese and French!"
"4258","Already have a Kindle Fire HDX, that I love.  However this Kindle 6 in. is great to just put in your pocketbook for a quick trip.  It's handy and very light weight."
"4259","I gave as gift. So far no complaints."
"4260","Great product with good price. Thanks"
"4261","Exactly what I wanted and works great"
"4262","I like it very much.  It's light,convenient to carry and easy to read. It provides more features than I expected. Still,I wish it were backlit--to read in the dark."
"4263","Really like this kindle. Very light weight. Previously I had been reading on my iPad and it is kind of heavy. Very easy to set up and borrow books from the library."
"4264","The price was awesome for catching the sale, it is perfect to carry on my purse, and the battery lasts for almost a month before charging.  The touch is really nice"
"4265","this is a great creature for reading!"
"4266","gave as gift, they can't put it down."
"4267","I love it! Excellent comfort to read."
"4268","Bought for my daughter, she loves it!"
"4269","Perfect size and convenient for trips"
"4270","Works perfectly.  No problems at all."
"4271","My daughter's favorite gift in years!"
"4272","Great product! I have an iPad but hated reading on it. The Kindle is ideal for reading. A little touchy with turning the pages butt that the only problem I've seen."
"4273","on time delivery, very good condition"
"4274","I like how my older no glare Kindle listed the books.  when you finished reading you could archive them and only see the unfinished books.Much less confusing"
"4275","This is a fabulous e reader and is truly glare free. I thought I would still prefer reading actual books, but this is convenient, lightweight and easy on the eyes."
"4276","CLEAR AND PRECISE , I'M LOVING IT !!!"
"4277","Exactly as expected, would buy again."
"4278","Love it. Have all my books everywhere"
"4279","Love my new kindle! Very easy to use."
"4280","Love it, light weight and easy to use"
"4281","MORE DIFFICULT THAN MY OLD ONE TO USE"
"4282","Perfect. Just what my husband needed!"
"4283","It was okay but the screen lags a lot"
"4284","Really, Amazon, a 48 page user guide?"
"4285","Light and easy on the hands and eyes."
"4286","I just did not like the size and the fact it was not able to reproduce some of my textbooks, which I rented from Amazon.Everything else is very high quality."
"4287","It seems like a quality product. I haven't had time to actually download anything to read just yet so I'm not sure how much I will like it or if I'll use it a lot."
"4288","It's a great gift to give. I jus recently purchased this as a gift for my mother and she loved it. I highly recommend this as a gift for anyone who loves reading."
"4289","Wish there was light for night reading"
"4290","Awesome too read my favorite book's on"
"4291","I bought this model because I just wanted a basic reading device.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have the option of back lighting, for reading in the dark."
"4292","When I am changing pages or trying to get to the home screen...the screen looks all jumbled and runs together and after it does that it goes to the correct screen"
"4293","Fantastic.  Puts my old Kindle to shame.  I can read in sunlight and in shade and even in dim lighting in our bedroom so as not to disturb my wife.  What a find!!"
"4294","I like my Kindle, but I don't like all the charges that come with ordering a book.  I downloaded two books at $1.99 each and my credit card was charged over $7.00"
"4295","Disappointed that I cannot find a cover with a light for this kindle. It cannot be read in the dark. Major inconvenience for me, I wish now I had bought the Fire."

"4414","I needed to get with the touch screen, makes reading so much easier. But I think the contrast of my old push button Kindle is way better.Sorry"
"4415","IT WAS TOO ANNOYING.  I RETURNED IT.  WHEN I WANT TO READ I DO NOT WANT TO BROWSE  ON A WEB PAGE I JUST WANT TO READ STORY'S.  IF I TOUCHED THE SCREEN AT ANY POINT, IT WAS EITHERTOO SENSITIVE OR IT DID NOT WORK RIGHT AWAY. THE FONT SIZE WOULD CHANGE WHEN I TOUCHED THE FRAME SO I WOULD GET 3 WORDS PER PAGE OR SO TINY I COULD NOT SEE IT. I COULD NOT TURN OFF THE WIFI TO SAVE MY BATTERY. IF I WAS NOT VERY CAREFUL TO TOUCH ONLY THE FRAME I WOULD GET ALL SORTS OF THINGS HAPPENING, WHICH WHEN I AM IN A GOOD PART OF THE STORY IT WAS AS I SAID BEFORE JUST PLAIN ANNOYING."
"4416","whatever genius decided to omit the speaker or even a headphone jackso those of us with an audible account can listen to our audio books is a buffoon.(way to treat a sister Amazon company like an uninvited guest there Bozo)As a reader it is ok~ but a single next page button would be superiorto the whole swiping experience waste of time distraction.It also became $20 cheaper the day after I got it on the ""easy payment""plan ...pretty stiff interest don'tcha think.bottom line ~ good reader only with buyers remorse ~ wish I had the discontinued old Kindle Touchit has everything I wanted ~ no backlit eye straining screen plus audio"

"4419","Just upgrade to this version and it is everything I wanted. Can still read while outside with the sun shining directly above me - does it get any better?"
"4420","I had an older Kindle so it took me a while to figure out the features.  Now that I have been using it, I love the smaller size for travel and the beach."

"4538","I had the 2nd edition prior to this one. I think this is such a poor design. The screen is to sensitve therefore constantly doing things I do not intend too like changing the font/page etc. the battery life seems rather short as well. I love the kindle with keyboard, much better design."

"4551","Love this more than just my iPad because when I sit down with it there are no Facebook, Pinterest etc temptations. It's purely for reading books."
"4552","Love it! So light and easy to carry to work"
"4553","Great kindle. Especially outdoors. Love it!"
"4554","It was perfect for my bookworm daughter!  Now she is able to find books on Amazon, as well as download books from the local library.  Fantastic!!"

"4559","Love it!!!! Lightweight. I don't like the advertisements at all. Very disappointing. Prefer wallpaper like previous kindles. Lose the ads please."
"4560","I enjoy the ease of reading.  You can change the size of the letters, when your eyesget tired.  It's real easy to bookmark your page."
"4561","I mean, it works, but its PDF handling capabilities are sub-par and the advertisements WILL eventually drive you insane and force you to pay $20 to remove them.Honestly, I would only reccomend this if you are trying to get the cheapest available reliable e-reader, and would definitely recommend getting the ""paperwhite"" version without advertisements & a backlight.Still, infinitely better than reading off of a LCD screen."
"4562","The product is easy to use and a pleasure when reading during the day; however I need a lot of light to read in the evening before going to bed."
"4563","Perfect size for before bed and at the beach"
"4564","I love almost everything about these beyond that they do NOT want to work with my wifi network.  This forces me to do all book adds through USB."

"4588","I've already had a problem with it, which was resolved.  I liked my old one better.  It required rebooting for the second time in three days."
"4589","You know you just totally ripped off nooks simple touch. Though added the parent controls and kindle unlimited. I like it cause I like my nook."
"4590","Does not have lighted background as other paper white editions.  Great if reading in lit room or outdoors, but cannot be read at night in dark."
"4591","We have one and bought this one as a gift for an 83 year old who loves to read books. This is a replacement for a generation one Kindle reader."
"4592","I love everything about my new kindle. It is very lightweight, fits  in my purse, it is easy to read and navigation of the device is so simple!"
"4593","Great device except for the idiotic charge connector.  Who thought of this crap?  I have 2 kindles that have trouble charging because of this cheap mini usb charging connector. No help from amazon on this what so ever.  My advice get an IPad. FIX THE DAMN CONNECTOR"

"4605","I love it! Best purchase I've made this year!"
"4606","Great reader though I prefer non touchscreen."
"4607","I never feared purchasing a refurbished Paperwhite, and we have had no issues with it. Having the need I would truly use these bargain items."
"4608","Long battery life. Daughter loves this e-reader. We love that it is pretty much just an e-reader. No distractions with internet surfing, etc."

"4617","So far it has done what I thought it would.  Didn't realize the screen did not light up so I can read in the dark but that is not a big deal."

"4681","It's okay. I am going to return it though and purchase the paper white version with a backlight. I don't have great lighting for reading."
"4682","Basic no frills e reader. I like my fire HD better, but for glare free reading in a very light compact case the touch is a great bargain."
"4683","I bought it specifically for a book reader and it works well. I have an iPad and could not handle the brightness. I still prefer paper :)"
"4684","The Kindle 6"" is a little buggy.  Sometimes the touchscreen doesn't work and it deletes all the highlights that I have made on the book.  Also, it is lags, it doesn't respond quick enough and it takes a while for it to respond."

"4696","Much improved from prior generations of readers"
"4697","My Kindle arrived on time and was packaged well"

"4701","i like it more, when it wasnt touch, and thiner"
"4702","Light weight but the processor is a bit slow, maybe that's why can the battery can lasts so long. Serves its purpose as an ebook reader."
"4703","Meets expectations. Possibly exceeds them even."

"4705","Great product and good value. Works as expected"
"4706","I am really enjoying my new kindle! The only reason it did not get five stars is because there is no way to adjust the brightness on it."

"4727","Decently priced but you do get what you pay for."
"4728","For the most part I am pleased with unit.  My sole complaint is that the unit needs to be re-charged more frequently than I would like."
"4729","Really great. My first kindle ever and I love it"
"4730","I bought this for my wife.  She loves it!  The ability to adjust text size in a reader that is so light weight is a huge bonus for her."
"4731","Exc product! It had to be from Amazon of course."

"5006","The battery barely lasts a day.  I fell for the ""battery lasts for weeks"" sales pitch and the truth is it only lasts 14 hours.  In the fine print I now find it says it lasts four weeks based on reading only 1/2 hour per day.  Who reads a book for only a half hour?"
"5007","It was a gift for my daughter and she loves her Kindle."

"5022","It's the first Kindle I've bought.  I always used my IPad for Kindle books before, but it's heavier and bigger, so I bought this little 6"" Kindle.  I didn't realize it was not backlit, which I really would prefer.  It also is a challenge to turn off.  I push the little button but it keeps either giving me a message to unlock the Kindle or keeps advertising books I might buy.  Annoying!  Otherwise, for the money, it does what it's supposed to do.  I wish I'd spent the extra money and bought the paperwhite."
"5023","I purchased this Kindle for my grandson as a gift. He was always reading mine or playing games on it. He loves to read!"
"5024","Love my newKindle, though it is a bit hard to navigate.  I know I'll get the hang of it soon and then all will be well."

"5246","Had a gen 4 but it broke so I had to replace.  Prior to that I had the gen 1.  I loved both of them.  This one is a huge disappointment.  The touch screen is really bad.  I was expecting a lot better.  Without a plastic protection screen it is super sensitive.  With the screen it barely functions.Additionally, half the home screen is ads plus recommended books that aren't actually anything I would want to purchase.  I dont mind the ads on the screensaver image.  But wasting my home screen space is really annoying.I am going to return this if I can find an unopened older model for sale."
"5247","Very easy to use-better than my old second generation Kindle"
"5248","It met all my expectations and its much lighter than holding a 400 page book.  I'm enjoying it enormously!!!"

"5250","I love my kindle!  It is so great to read and I can order so many books too.  I recommend it to everyone!!!!"

"5290","I liked my Kindle with the push buttons MUCH BETTER!  Don't like having the pictures of book covers.  Prefer having list of books written out.  Not as easy to access or find books in Archives and not as convenient to read previews of books and to order books.  Regret having the Special Offers feature."
"5291","It was not bright enough to use without a light on at night."
"5292","Love it, it does everything it's supposed to, it's light, easy to handle, and very cute with the red cover."
"5293","It is great for reading.  Best buy did not make it clear that it came with ads.  That is the only drawback."
"5294","I got two of these at a great price and they were delivered quickly to become much loved Christmas presents"

After a day reading the operational information, I still do not know how to load books that I previously bought, load the Washington Post, or order new books.  The screen now has oil from my hands on it.  A great improvement!  Also, I can not get the Kindle to change the page in a  consistent  manner."
"5355","It was very interesting, kept me involved throughout.  Sad circumstances.  No judgment about the first call to ""stand down.""  Hindsight is perfect.  Very credible.  The story of war.  Unfortunately, the story of the region."
